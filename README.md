# NLP-Webcrawler
A spider that crawls Forbes business news articles

## Part 1: Web crawler crawls all news from www.forbes.com/business
Save each piece of the article as one txt document.
<br>
Please note that by “all news”, it means that you are supposed to crawl those after you click the button “More Articles” as well.

## Part 2: Choose 1 article from step 1 output, which talks about any companies
Write codes to do the following pre-processing steps:
- Remove all company names showed in the article
- Regular Expression/Normalization — lowercase the words, remove punctuation and remove numbers
- Tokenization
- Remove stop words 
- Stemming and lemmatization
- Any other pre-processing steps you think is necessary to prepare this input for topic modelling
