"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."
The Future Of Real Estate: Fintech 50 2021,"Four financial technology companies that are revolutionizing the real estate market made the Forbes Fintech 50 2021 list.,From the abyss of an economy-stopping global pandemic, the U.S. real estate market has emerged as arguably the hottest market in the world. Low interest rates and a future of working from home, or at least more flexible office arrangements, caused many Americans to relocate to suburban areas with lower costs and a higher quality of life. The pandemic-driven shifts ignited a residential housing boom and novel financial technology played a huge role in the surging market. ,Among private technology companies, startups targeting the inefficiencies and headaches of the real estate market are surging in value and growing at staggering rates. The process of getting a mortgage has long been considered a tedious slog of paperwork, and there have been few innovations to introduce young Americans to home ownership since the advent of the mortgage bond. ,Well-funded startups, including the four on the latest Forbes ,Fintech 50 list,, have stepped up to address this demand, with innovative technology that’s simplifying and opening the real estate market to a new generation. Our Fintech 50 list highlights companies like Blend Labs, with its white-label software that ,allows mortgages at some of America’s biggest banks to be done in just a few clicks,, and Divvy Homes, a landlord that wants to help its tenants become owners. These companies are using technology to redesign the experience of buying, selling and owning property.,Overall, through the use of new technology, there has never been lower friction to buying a home and the transaction costs across the market have plummeted. The pandemic-plagued year also was an opportunity for some innovative former Fintech 50 list members to join public stock markets, including Opendoor Technologies, a so-called iBuyer of homes that ,went public in December 2020, and now carries a $10 billion valuation.,Here are the financial technology companies revolutionizing the real estate market that made the Forbes Fintech 50 in 2021, including a brief description of what they do, who their users are and how much they’re worth.,Blend Labs' CEO and cofounder Nima Ghamsari.

Uber Veteran Launches Her ‘AI Mindset’ Self-Driving Startup With $83.5 Million Round,"Waabi founder and CEO Raquel Urtasun, a computer scientist and University of Toronto professor, sees a new path to commercializing self-driving technology.,Computer scientist Raquel Urtasun, an artificial intelligence expert who led a team of Toronto-based engineers for Uber’s self-driving vehicle program, is launching tech startup Waabi with an $83.5 million funding round and a new “AI mindset” approach to commercializing automated driving.,The Series A round, among the biggest for any Canadian tech startup, is led by Khosla Ventures and includes investment from Uber, Radical Ventures, 8VC, OMERS Ventures and BDC Capital’s Women in Technology Venture Fund. Aurora Innovation, the self-driving tech company that ,acquired Uber ATG last December,, is a minority investor. AI experts including Stanford University’s Fei-Fei Li, the University of Toronto’s Geoffrey Hinton and Sanja Fidler and the University of California, Berkeley’s Pieter Abbeel also participated in the round. ,The initial application of its technology is automating long-haul trucks, though it’s not saying when that might begin. Waabi isn’t disclosing a company valuation based on the Series A, nor is it saying who will sit on its board. ,The company (whose name is inspired by an Ojibwe word meaning “she has vision”) aims to set itself apart from companies that have raised billions of dollars, such as Waymo, Cruise, Zoox, Argo AI, TuSimple and Aurora, by relying heavily on cutting-edge AI tools and less of what Urtasun calls a traditional “robotics mindset.” The latter requires vastly more data, solving an almost endless list of tasks and incalculable miles of on-road driving to train the software. ,Waabi CEO Raquel Urtasun was previously chief scientist and head of Uber ATG's Toronto unit.,Waabi’s approach relies on a “new generation of AI algorithms that combine deep learning, probabilistic inference and complex optimization” that makes it possible to “generalize and learn from a small amount of data,” Urtasun says. Her company has also developed a closed-loop computer simulation system to test and train the driving software that, ideally, will be applicable in multiple geographies. ,“You end up with an approach that requires much less to actually develop. It’s much less capital-intensive and doesn't require this driving and driving and driving on the road. You get much more automated, fast-paced solutions, and with the ability to come up with much more complex systems,” she says. ,The Spanish native’s startup arrives amid a period of consolidation within the autonomous driving industry, a major management change at Waymo and growing uncertainty about exactly how soon robotaxis, self-driving trucks and autonomous urban delivery vehicles will be ready for wide-scale deployment. With the creation of Waabi, Urtasun also becomes the third woman to lead a self-driving tech company, joining Zoox CEO Aicha Evans and ,Tekedra Mawakana, Waymo’s new co-CEO,.,When ,Uber hired Urtasun in May 2017, as a chief scientist to lead a tech hub in Toronto, where she is also a professor of computer science at the University of Toronto, former CEO Travis Kalanick called her “one of the world’s leading researchers in the fields of machine perception and artificial intelligence.” (Urtasun also recently served as a judge for Forbes’ ,AI 50 2021: America’s Most Promising Artificial Intelligence Companies,.),""Raquel is truly one-of-a-kind—a tenacious and inspiring leader who empowers those around her to excel,” said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi.,“Not everything in consolidation is good. One of the problems is that you have less and less diversity of approach.” ,Sven Strohband, managing director at Khosla Ventures, said “with a dream team that has been at the forefront of innovation in the industry and a differentiated, AI-first approach, Waabi is well-positioned to lead the next generation of self-driving technology.” ,Arriving at a period of industry consolidation—and some frustration with the overall pace of development—is “exactly the right time to start a company,” says Urtasun.,“We've seen a lot of consolidation and that makes sense when you have a very capital intensive approach. But not everything in consolidation is good. One of the problems is that you have less and less diversity of approach,” she says. “If you’re trying to solve such a difficult problem as self-driving, and you're all going with a single approach, chances of really solving this are much smaller than if you try to solve it with a diverse set of approaches.”"
Remote-Controlled Labs? Strateos Raises $56 Million To Build Out Its Vision Of Scientific Automation,"Strateos CEO Mark Fischer-Colbrie at the company's Menlo Park, California, lab.,A,fter Mark Fischer-Colbrie sold liquid-handling company Labcyte, where he’d been CEO for more than a decade, to a division of Danaher in 2019, he could have retired. But when Fischer-Colbrie, now 64, heard about the opportunity to become CEO of Strateos, a Menlo Park, California-based startup that develops remote-access labs and lab-control software for life sciences research, he signed on.,“I didn’t have to do this,” he says. “I could’ve gone off to do other things or not worked at all. But this is such a big opportunity to rethink how life sciences research is done.”,His vision: a worldwide network of these remote-controlled labs that could work with both chemistry and biology. Today, Strateos said that it had raised $56 million, led by DCVC and Lux Capital, to build out that vision. The new investment brings Strateos’ total funding to around $90 million at an estimated valuation of $200 million.,“The sophistication of Strateos’ software and robotics make it possible to command, copy and modify complex experiments, run them in parallel and deliver insights and results, in many cases exponentially faster and at dramatically lower cost,” says Matt Ocko, a managing partner at DCVC, who first invested in the company back at the seed round.,Back in 2012, Max Hodak founded Strateos’ ,predecessor company, Transcriptic,, straight out of college at Duke University. Hodak had already built and sold a previous startup, called MyFit, which focused on helping students identify the right colleges. But as a student researcher, he grew frustrated with the amount of wasted time in the lab and the difficulties scientists have doing what are essentially detailed, robotic processes like transferring minuscule amounts of liquid. With Transcriptic, he developed a robotic cloud laboratory platform for life sciences research.,In 2019, Transcriptic merged with 3Scan, which uses automation, machine learning and computer vision to extract spatial data from tissue samples and create detailed 3-D representations. The merged company, named Strateos, hired Fischer-Colbrie as its new CEO. Fischer-Colbrie, who competes in Ironman and Half Ironman triathlons (“Just to stay in shape,” he says), had previously helped take three companies public before becoming CEO of Labcyte. “Mark is the antithesis of the preening rock star CEO,” Ocko says.,“This represents a real shift to flexible automation and industrialization. Labs should be thought of as data engines.” ,Deep tech like this is hard, and the company has largely been under the radar as it built the software and began to deploy it. Last year, it unveiled its first 11,500-square-foot remote-access lab in San Diego, in conjunction with pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, to accelerate drug discovery. It also has a smaller lab in Menlo Park, California, and has signed on some 100 customers, including biotech firms like Amgen and Abbvie, synthetic biology company Ginkgo Bioworks and the federal Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, for projects or software.,Historically, Fischer-Colbrie says, scientific labs have been “shockingly poor” at getting good data, which has slowed down their research efforts. “A lot of life sciences is done 1850s-style,” he says. “It takes a long time and it costs a lot.”,Strateos’ software, by contrast, can combine robotic machinery together in automated modules and allow researchers to run their labs from anywhere. At Strateos, Fischer-Colbrie figures there’s an opportunity to increase revenue from tens of millions today (he declines to be more exact) to hundreds of millions as the company deploys its labs worldwide. “This represents a real shift to flexible automation and industrialization,” he says. “Labs should be thought of as data engines.” ,In a video tour of the sprawling San Diego lab, the gleaming equipment of 23 robotic modules connected with a giant automated track, looks more like a chip foundry. With Strateos, users log on to a Web app and the software guides the experiments, determining where the robotic arms should move the materials or what temperature and pressure a reactor should use. Strateos now runs the lab and can offer its capacity to customers beyond Lilly, using privacy controls in the software to keep different customers’ experiments and data separate. Scale? The facility is capable of doing 190,000 experiments per day. “When you are inside this building, you feel like you are in a silicon wafer foundry or a data center,” says Ben Miles, Strateos’ head of product. “There’s the hum of the HVAC going, and all these robots doing everything in the module.”,The combination of better data and more automation should speed up drug discovery and advances in synthetic biology. A new therapeutic might take 60 cycles of variations, Fischer-Colbrie says, and if each one takes weeks or months, that adds up to years of discovery work. “We think we can cut that time in half at least, and that’s before you add in the AI tools. That’s just raw speed and data reliability,” he says. ,Fischer-Colbrie ultimately envisions scores of these giant automated labs across the globe, including in Europe and Asia. The company is currently in talks with potential partners to open a lab on the East Coast, he says, though those plans remain at the discussion stage. In an even earlier stage is the company’s technology for tissue sampling. “If you can accelerate discovery,” he says, “you can go after medium or small markets, or even rare disease areas, economically.”"
Smart-Lock Startup Latch Rides SPAC Frenzy To $1.5 Billion Valuation,"Smart-lock maker Latch began trading on Monday.,Smart-lock startup Latch began trading Monday through a SPAC listing that raised $453 million and values the company at over $1.5 billion. The shares, issued through a special purpose acquisition vehicle run by Tishman Speyer Properties, rose 4% on the first day of trading. ,“Using the Tishman Speyer portfolio as an incubator for new ideas and new products...was really just too good to pass up,” says Latch’s cofounder and CEO, Luke Schoenfelder, who made the Forbes Under 30 ,list, in 2018.,Latch, which had revenue of just $18 million last year, was founded in 2013 and is best known for its smart-locks, which can be unlocked with a smartphone. Schoenfelder, 32, and his cofounders stumbled on the concept after trying to solve a simpler problem: “How do you run out of orange juice in the morning and have a fresh carton delivered directly into your refrigerator at the end of the day?” Latch’s CFO Garth Mitchell told ,Forbes ,earlier this year. ,The team realized that property access was the first hurdle to executing that concept, and soon homed in on the smart-lock market. They targeted residential properties at the outset, since the potential to scale was so much higher than commercial businesses.,Latch was valued at more than $400 million after its Series B round raised $126 million in 2019, when one-in-ten new multi-family projects across the U.S. utilized its technology. The company says it will use the new funding to expand into Europe and grow new business segments in the commercial space. A year ago, when offices shuttered and renters fled from major cities, things looked far more grim. “We had to make some tough choices in the spring to bring our burn down,” Mitchell says.,Now rental demand ,is rebounding, in many urban areas and commercial landlords are eyeing the return of workers to offices, while new safety protocols have made contactless entry systems more appealing. Latch launched Visitor Express, a contactless system for offices, in early 2021. Overall it says its products have been purchased or reserved in over 300,000 units across the country, mainly residential. Revenue has risen from under $15 million in 2019 to $18 million last year, according to public filings, but losses have also swelled, from $50 million to $66 million. ,The company followed many of its peers to market through a SPAC listing, which allows firms to skirt the scrutiny of a traditional initial public offering, including wading through some regulatory requirements and conducting roadshows that allow potential investors to question executives about opportunities and risks. ,SPACs provide a faster way to market by taking a publicly traded shell company (the SPAC) and merging it with a target business like Latch. Investors in the shell company generally take large fees, creating a ,no-lose opportunity, for many of their backers and a much riskier scenario for less sophisticated retail investors who are drawn to the hype.,Latch and its peers are now bellwethers for those risks, says Howard Schilit, author of ,Financial Shenanigans,. Porch and Opendoor have already gone public through SPACs, while WeWork, Better, Sonder and Offerpad are planning listings to do so. And it’s not limited to real estate. PWC cited the “continued SPAC attack” as the driver behind 389 IPOs completed in the ,first quarter, of the year that raised a total of $125 billion.,“There always have been successful SPACs, despite the fact that on average SPACs have never been a good investment for public shareholders,” says Michael Klausner, the Nancy and Charles Munger Professor of Business at Stanford Law School. He adds that “the SPAC bubble seems to be deflating. One never knows when a bubble will burst or fully deflate, but I think a reasonable inference from the market is that the deflation process is happening.”,Schoenfelder, for his part, insists that Latch would have gone public with or without a SPAC bubble, noting the multiple merger offers he fielded. ,“If you look at the institutional investors that participated in our transaction...Fidelity, BlackRock, Wellington,” he says, “I think there would have been appetite in lots of different permutations.”"
The World’s Richest Sports Team Owners 2021,"Mukesh Ambani, Steve Ballmer,I,t has been an ascendant 12 months for India’s richest person, Mukesh Ambani. His cricket team, the Mumbai Indians, were Indian Premier League champions for the second year in a row. And off the field, shares of his multinational conglomerate, Reliance Industries, rose more than 85% over the last 12 months—helping more than double Ambani’s net worth to $84.5 billion.,That’s enough to make Ambani the world’s richest sports team owner. He surpasses last year’s No. 1, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, for the top spot.,Ballmer, who owns the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, has also seen his fortune grow, although not enough to keep up with Ambani. His net worth is now $68.7 billion, according to ,Forbes,, up from $52.7 billion a year ago. ,The bar for entry onto the list of the richest sports team owners has gotten dramatically higher since early 2020, amid what has been a record year for billionaire wealth. The top 20 billionaire controlling owners of teams in major sports leagues now have a combined net worth of $427 billion, up from ,$266 billion last year,, according to ,Forbes,. That’s a 60% increase over the past 12 months—even though many sports arenas and stadiums have remained mostly empty amid the pandemic.,Of course, Covid-19 hasn’t curbed fans’ appetite or stopped major deals from happening. Hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen, for example, finally won approval from Major League Baseball for his roughly $2.4 billion purchase of the New York Mets in October 2020. That deal has earned Cohen a spot on the list of the world’s richest sports team owners for the first time.,Another notable newcomer: billionaire Home Depot cofounder Arthur Blank. After stepping down as co-chairman of the retail giant in 2001, he purchased the Atlanta Falcons football team the following year for $545 million (now ,worth, nearly $1.9 billion net of debt, according to ,Forbes,’ estimates). Blank also brought professional soccer to the city with his Major League Soccer team Atlanta United FC, which played its inaugural season in 2017. ,The biggest gainer on the list this year—in both dollar and percentage terms—is, by far, Dan Gilbert, the billionaire mortgage tycoon and owner of the NBA’s Cleveland Cavaliers. He’s worth an estimated $51.9 billion, a nearly 700% increase from last year thanks to the company he cofounded in 1985, Quicken Loans. Now the largest mortgage lender in the United States, Quicken went public as Rocket Companies at a massive $36 billion valuation in August 2020, ,catapulting, Gilbert up the ranks of the world’s richest billionaires.,Dan Gilbert.,Dietrich Mateschitz.,Steve Cohen.,David Tepper.,Stanley Kroenke.,Arthur Blank.,Italian billionaire Rocco Commisso, owner of soccer team ACF Fiorentina, was added to the list at #16. That bumped Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons, to #21 on the list."
Kanye West’s Yeezy Gap Launch Isn’t Sold Out. But It’s Still Good News For The Billionaire’s Fortune,"Kanye West announced his Yeezy Gap collaboration last year, causing a surge the retailer's ,... [+], share-price. ,Yeezy Gap, Kanye West’s much-awaited line with the retailer, is finally here—and it’s already flying off the shelves. ,On Tuesday, West’s 44th birthday, a $200 blue nylon, unisex puffer jacket dubbed the “RoundJacket” became available to preorder. Within a few hours, the jacket, which will ship this fall, had seemingly sold out. A spokesperson for Yeezy Gap said that the jacket was still available to pre-order, but due to high demand, customers were seeing a “sold out” message.,If the success of the jacket’s launch is any indication of how well Yeezy Gap will do, West stands to make a fortune from the 10-year partnership, which entitles him to royalty payments based on sales. West may also get up to 8.5 million shares of Gap stock if the line hits certain sales goals, a deal that could add tens of millions of dollars to West’s fortune based on the current stock price.,The Yeezy partnership has already been a win for Gap’s stock. When the deal was announced last June, Gap shares ,surged nearly 40%,. As of noon Tuesday, the company’s stock had risen 2.5% from the previous day. ,West is currently worth $1.8 billion, by ,Forbes,’ estimates, with the bulk of that attributed to his Yeezy sneaker line The collection pulled in an estimated $1.7 billion in revenue in 2020 through its partnership with Adidas—earning West $191 million in royalties last year. The rest of his fortune is made up of his music catalogue (worth an estimated $90 million), his stake in soon-to-be ex-wife Kim Kardashian West’s shapewear company Skims (worth an estimated $64 million) and a handful of other assets, including cash, real estate, jewelry and even livestock (worth an estimated $160 million). ,While bank documents ,Forbes ,saw earlier this year suggested Yeezy Gap was worth as much as $1.5 billion based on future projected earnings, ,Forbes ,declined to value the company, until it started to bring in revenue. With the first batch of Yeezy Gap apparel hitting the market—and demand proving high—it seems the world’s richest rapper is about to get even richer.,This story has been updated to reflect that the “sold out” message customers were seeing was a glitch due to high demand.,The first item in the Yeezy Gap collaboration, called the ""round jacket,"" sold out within hours."
Kim Kardashian West Is Officially A Billionaire," Kim Kardashian,W,hen Kim Kardashian West was first mentioned in the pages of ,Forbes, in 2011, it was simply a tally of her Twitter followers: 6.6 million, just below Barack Obama and just above Ashton Kutcher. Five years later, she graced the ,cover, of ,Forbes, thanks to her booming mobile game, which helped her earn $51 million that year. Now, she officially joins the World’s Billionaires list for the first time.,Forbes ,estimates that Kardashian West is now worth $1 billion, up from $780 million in October, thanks to two lucrative businesses—KKW Beauty and Skims—as well as cash from reality television and endorsement deals, and a number of smaller investments.,Kardashian West founded KKW Beauty in 2017, following the success of her half-sister Kylie Jenner’s Kylie Cosmetics. She borrowed from Kylie’s playbook, using a similar direct-to-consumer model that relies heavily on social media marketing. Her first launch, 300,000 contour kits, ,sold out within two hours,. By 2018, the business had expanded into eyeshadows, concealers, lipsticks and fragrances, and was bringing in about ,$100 million in revenue.,""It’s the first time I've moved away from having licensing deals and transitioned into being an owner,"" Kardashian West told ,Forbes, in 2017, when she announced her cosmetics line.,She cashed in on that ownership last year when she sold 20% of KKW Beauty to cosmetics conglomerate Coty for $200 million, a deal that valued the company at $1 billion. While ,Forbes, estimates that figure is a little bloated—Coty, which also bought 51% of Kylie Cosmetics in 2020, is known for overpaying—her remaining 72% stake is still worth about $500 million, by our count.,Then there’s Skims, the shapewear line Kardashian West launched in 2019. She raised money from fashion insiders like Net-a-Porter’s Natalie Massane and Theory’s Andrew Rosen, and capitalized on her massive social media following to shill the brand. (She now has 69.6 million Twitter followers and 213 million followers on Instagram.) Skims has been quick on its feet: During the pandemic, when consumers became more interested in comfy clothes for the couch than in smoothing their stomachs under evening gowns, she swiftly started turning the focus to loungewear.,Kardashian West owns a majority stake in closely-held Skims, which hasn’t disclosed its revenues. A source familiar with Skims told ,Forbes ,about a transaction that values the shapewear company north of $500 million. As a result, ,Forbes, estimates her Skims stake is worth a conservative $225 million, enough to lift her fortune to $1 billion.,The rest of Kardashian West’s fortune sits in cash and investments, including real estate. Every year since 2012, she has earned at least $10 million pretax, by ,Forbes’, count, thanks to paychecks from ,Keeping Up With the Kardashians, ,endorsement deals and endeavors like the aforementioned mobile game and her now-defunct Kimoji app. She’s also got three properties in Calabasas, northwest of Los Angeles, and a portfolio of blue-chip investments, including shares of Disney, Amazon, Netflix and Adidas that her soon-to-be ex-husband Kanye West gifted her for Christmas in 2017. ,But it’s the companies that she has launched herself, and grown with the typical Kardashian flare for self-promotion, that land her on the World’s Billionaires list.

"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
El Salvador Makes History As World’s First Country To Make Bitcoin Legal Tender,"El Salvador has become the first country in the world to formally adopt cryptocurrency after its Congress voted overwhelmingly to approve a law classifying Bitcoin as legal tender, President Nayib Bukele ,said, Wednesday, an initiative he hopes will boost foreign investment, improve financial inclusion and generate jobs. ,Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele ,Bukele, who ,announced, plans to introduce a bill adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador Saturday, said a supermajority of legislators in Congress had approved the law in a vote Wednesday. ,The bill secured 62 out of 84 possible votes, Bukele ,said,.,“History!” he ,added, on Twitter.,Bitcoin is ,set, to become legal tender in 90 days, meaning every business must accept the token for goods and services, alongside the U.S. Dollar. ,Bukele has previously ,said, this will make financial services accessible to the 70% of Salvadorans who do not have bank accounts and ease the transfer of remittances from abroad that make up ,around, 20% of the country’s GDP. , ,El Salvador has used the U.S. Dollar as official currency since 2001, which Bitcoin will join, not replace. The vote marks a major milestone in monetary history and could be a ,gamechanger, for business worldwide as Bitcoin becomes a more practical asset and the Central American state a cryptocurrency hub. The support of a nation state also could go a long way to dispel widespread skepticism of Bitcoin's long term utility and acceptance, though fears will remain over the token’s volatility.

Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination.

The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices.

The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally-built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could commission as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."
"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."

[+], boy band BTS visit the ""Today"" Show at Rockefeller Plaza on February 21, 2020 in New York City. (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images),BTS control the Billboard Global 200 chart once again this week, as their new single “Butter” doesn’t move an inch. The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world.

Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,...

Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."
"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."
How An Ex-Semipro Poker Player Bet Big And Won The $4.3 Trillion Mortgage Market,"Hot Hand: Nima Ghamsari in the Beverly Hills home where he has worked during the pandemic as his business exploded and his software powered nearly a third of the U.S. mortgage market. ,A,mong, ,the big surprises of the pandemic economy was the housing boom. As fleeing city dwellers and cramped work-from-home families bid up the price of spacious suburban homes, rock-bottom interest rates enticed existing homeowners to refinance in record numbers. By the end of last year, 13.6 million mortgages worth $4.3 trillion had been closed, shattering the previous all-time record of $3.7 trillion in 2003., ,It was a miraculous feat, considering that most of that lending was done while in-person meetings were taboo and overworked loan officers operated from ad hoc home offices as their dogs barked and children fidgeted through remote classes. ,Truth is, the mortgage market probably would have melted down were, ,it not for a secret weapon: Nima Ghamsari, a 35-year-old Iranian immigrant who made hundreds of thousands of dollars playing poker online while at Stanford; joined secretive big-data startup Palantir Technologies upon graduation; and then, at just 26, quit that dream job to start his own software company, Blend Labs, in 2012. “I have always felt like I wanted to bet on myself. I’m willing to take a lot of risk,” he says matter-of-factly.,""Venture capitalists doubted us. I can’t even count how many times I’ve heard them say, ‘This will never work,’ or ‘[banks] won’t actually use it,’ ” Ghamsari recalls. ,Though invisible to ordinary borrowers and comparatively low-profile in its Silicon Valley home, Blend has had a staggering impact. It now provides digital infrastructure to 287 U.S. banks, including such big mortgage lenders as Wells Fargo and First Republic Bank. In 2020, Blend software was used to process $1.4 trillion in mortgage and consumer loans, up nearly threefold from the prior year. Its staff grew to 750 from 425 before the pandemic. Blend’s revenue doubled last year to about $100 million, ,Forbes, estimates. ,Thanks in no small part to Blend, the mortgage application, underwriting and closing process—once a weeks- or months-long slog of paperwork, emails, faxes and phone calls—can now be done almost entirely digitally. Blend saves an average of 7.3 days and $520 in operational costs per loan and allows a typical banker to close 14 mortgages a month, consultancy MarketWise Advisors estimates. Blend seamlessly integrates with CoreLogic for credit scores, Plaid to check on bank, ,accounts and Google Maps for location data. This enables some banks to offer home hunters quick tentative mortgage approvals with a few mouse clicks—a huge, ,plus in a white-hot housing market.,“We all got stressed last year with the crush of volume,” says Tom Wind, president of US Bank Home Mortgage, one of Blend’s largest customers. “We were able to serve more customers last year because of efficiencies we have with Blend.” In 2020, US Bank saw a 136% increase in mortgage fee revenue without having to increase staff. ,Ghamsari and Blend have produced results by bucking convention on Sand Hill Road. Instead of seeking to disrupt the banks (a common fintech goal), he decided to retrofit them, charging for the service. His rationale: He wouldn’t have to waste time and money on consumer marketing and could potentially make financial services easier to access for 100 million consumers instead of maybe a million or two.,In January, fresh off its banner year, Blend raised $300 million from blue-chip investors including Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global and Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management at a $3.3 billion valuation, doubling its worth in a span of five months. In April, Blend filed confidential documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a possible initial public offering, which (given that Blend has an incentive-laden compensation structure similar to Tesla’s) could launch Ghamsari on the road to billionaire status—if Blend performs well. There are whispers that SPACs have shown interest in merging with Blend at double its latest valuation, though Ghamsari won’t comment. ,Blend is a standout on this year’s ,Forbes’, ,Fintech 50,, which celebrates private startups transforming financial services. Twenty of the Fintech 50 ,are new this year,, reflecting the energy and record venture capital pouring into the sector, the impact of Covid-19 and the fact that ,seven of last year’s picks,, including crypto exchange Coinbase and Opendoor Technologies, which buys homes quickly for cash, have since gone public. Counting Blend, at least four current members of the Fintech 50 are considering listing on the public markets. ,Yet few have had so much impact on ordinary folks’ lives. Since the end of World War II, owning a home has been at the center of the American Dream—as it was for Ghamsari’s own family. He moved to the U.S. from Iran in 1987 when he was a year old, as his parents pursued graduate studies at the University of Michigan and then settled down in Cincinnati, where his dad taught math at the University of Cincinnati and his mother taught chemistry at Xavier University. After years of renting, Ghamsari’s parents were finally, ,approved in 1998 for a low-down-payment mortgage and purchased a no-frills two-story home in Cincinnati for about $100,000. It was the rock their family prospered upon. They later became franchisees of a tutoring company, employing their brainy teenage son to grade and tutor students. ,That wasn’t the only way the ambitious Ghamsari kept busy before graduating from high school first in his class. He worked at McDonald’s, Starbucks and Circuit City, rebuilt Dell computers and taught himself to code. At Stanford, a need-based scholarship helped cover tuition, but Ghamsari tried his hand at online poker to help pay for living expenses. Soon, when he wasn’t studying, he was playing day and night, with his winnings extending well into the six figures. “It was my first taste of something where, if I really put a lot of energy and effort into getting better, how good the outcomes could be over a very long run,” he says.,To make more time for poker, Ghamsari bought a gas-powered golf cart to get around Stanford’s sprawling 8,000-acre campus faster. “I really optimize my time around doing the things that I want to do. I try to make everything that I don’t want to do be as efficient—ideally nonexistent—as possible,’’ he explains. (Stealing a page from Steve Jobs’ playbook, he has 30 black T-shirts, he says, because “I don’t like spending time thinking about what I’m going to wear.”) ,Ghamsari’s vision is hardly modest. He argues that software can eliminate tens of billions of dollars a year of unneeded friction in the financial system. “In 10 years, finance is going to be truly digital and proactive in real time.’’ ,With little regard for the brilliant undergraduate’s precious time, campus police impounded Ghamsari’s forbidden golf cart. “It was totally obnoxious for me to have, in retrospect,’’ he concedes. No matter. By the time he graduated with a computer science degree in 2008, he had bought an Aston Martin and been recruited by the ultra-secretive big-data startup Palantir Technologies, originally funded by the CIA’s venture arm. He was assigned to Palantir’s push to deploy its software inside America’s then-teetering big banks, whose patchwork, decades-old technology infrastructure gave them a poor grasp of their problematic mortgage exposures. Ghamsari saw up close the massive opportunity to disrupt banks—or to transform them.,“The insight Palantir had was that there was this immense growth in the amount of data being captured by organizations, but there was no way to harness that data for operational things,” he says. “You had to literally read pieces of paper, because all the data in the mortgage industry at the time was done in an analog way.” ,Like other employees, Ghamsari had stock options and could have, ,cashed in when Palantir eventually, ,went public in 2020. Instead, in 2012, he and two other young colleagues (former quant trader Rosco Hill and engineer Eugene Marinelli) founded Blend together with Erin Collard, the head trader of billionaire Peter Thiel’s hedge fund, Clarium Capital, to bring new cloud-based technology to the earthbound banks. They gained early backing from Thiel and Max Levchin, now, ,worth $1.4 billion thanks to his newly public fintech, Affirm, which allows people to pay for items in installments. The four founders first worked out of Ghamsari’s cramped San Francisco apartment, until his roommates complained. So they rented a Mission Bay apartment, which they used as offices, hauling sleeping bags into closets for naps during round-the-clock coding sessions.,At first, venture capitalists, focused on fast, disruptive growth, were skeptical of Blend’s approach. Winning business from stodgy banks was uncertain, they warned, and there were only so many banks to sell to. “Venture, ,capitalists doubted us. I can’t even count how many times I’ve heard them say, ‘This will never work,’ or ‘[banks] won’t actually use it,’ ” Ghamsari recalls. ,But changes in the mortgage market eventually played into Ghamsari’s hands. In an effort to cut risk after the 2008 financial crisis, large lenders like Bank of America and Wells Fargo started offloading hundreds of billions in mortgages to third-party servicers. Those servicers needed help managing their massive new portfolios and were more open to getting it from young tech wizards than banks might have been. Early Blend customers included Nationstar Mortgage (now Mr. Cooper), the country’s third-largest mortgage servicer.,Blend’s big break, however, came courtesy of a competitor. In 2015, Dan Gilbert, the Quicken Loans billionaire, launched Rocket Mortgage, which cut mortgage closing times from over 40 days to just a month—similar to what Blend was offering. “Every bank’s board woke up and said, ‘Oh, my God, we need to find a solution to compete with this, because if we don’t, we’re going to lose volume to Rocket.’ Blend was one of those answers,” recalls Jeffrey Reitman, a partner at Blend investor Canapi Ventures. ,Through the first half of 2017, Blend, ,received just $67 million in outside funding. But after VCs saw it had won Wells Fargo, US Bank and mortgage originator Movement Mortgage as customers, they started calling. In August 2017, Blend raised $100 million at a half-billion-dollar valuation in a round led by Greylock with Emergence Capital, 8VC, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Nyca Partners. ,With that cash, Ghamsari was able to add hundreds of smaller banks as customers. He also expanded functionality, giving borrowers the ability to upload documents and banks the ability to manage more of the closing process, as well as the applications process, digitally. In 2019, Blend raised a further $130 million and hired Tim Mayopoulos, the now 62-year-old former CEO of Fannie Mae, as its president, giving it instant credibility with banks and government-backed mortgage finance agencies, known in the trade as GSEs. Ghamsari “came and visited me in my office, and he was this scruffy guy in a black T-shirt,’’ Mayopoulos recalls. “But it was clear that he had the same vision about how the system ought to work that I did: It should all be driven by reliable data that gets shared with all the key participants in the process, from the consumer to the lender to the ultimate holder of the credit risk [the GSEs].”,Blend isn’t stopping at mortgages—or banks. By 2019, it had launched paper-reducing software, ,for, ,homeowner’s insurance and home-equity and auto loans. It’s also enabling homebuilder Lennar to offer mortgages. In March, it agreed to acquire title-insurance and settlement company Title365 for $422 million, with the aim of integrating even more of the home closing process into its services—and collecting insurance fees. ,Ghamsari’s vision is hardly modest. He argues that software can eliminate tens of billions of dollars a year of unneeded friction in the financial system. “In 10 years, finance is going to be truly digital and proactive in real time,’’ he says. Consumers will open an app and get real-time recommendations, based on their individual financial picture, with Blend powering it all. If that happens, he adds, “This will be one of the biggest companies in the world.”"
Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."
Michigan Governor Whitmer's Pipeline Move Declares War On Aviation,"Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer introduces Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden to speak ,...

 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."

Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."

"3 In 10 Republicans Believe Wacky Conspiracy Theory Trump Will Be ‘Reinstated’ As President This Year, Poll Shows","While most Americans dismiss the possibility, a significant chunk of Republicans believe the conspiracy theory buoyed by some of Donald Trump’s allies (and, reportedly, believed by the former president himself) that he’ll be back in the White House by the end of the year, a poll published Wednesday suggests. ,Former U.S. President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower in Manhattan on May 18, 2021 in New York City. ,... [+], ,The ,Politico,/Morning Consult ,survey, of 1,990 registered voters found respondents were broadly dismissive of the notion Trump could be “reinstated” as president. ,A decisive majority (72%) across the political spectrum deemed it “not very likely” or “not likely at all” Trump will have his old job by the end of the year. ,However, self-identified Republicans were less quick to dismiss the conspiracy theory. ,While 61% of GOP respondents labeled Trump’s return unlikely, some 29% said they believe he will be made president again. ,This compares to 84% of the Democrats surveyed who said Trump won’t be reinstated and 13% who said he will be. ,All in all, 19% of the people surveyed for the poll said it was either “somewhat likely” or “very likely” Trump will be reinstated as president this year. ,The conspiracy theory Trump will be reinstated as president, which has become popular among ,QAnon believers,, stems from the false claims still being pushed by some Republicans that the 2020 election was rigged. Trump has ,reportedly, become fixated with the ongoing GOP-commissioned election audit in Arizona and is pushing for similar ballot reviews across the country, telling allies (though daughter-in-law Lara Trump has since ,denied, this) the success of the recounts could result in his return to the White House this year. Of course, election officials across the country have maintained that last year’s presidential election was one of the safest in history and have denied the possibility it was marred by widespread fraud. ,As ,Forbes, has previously ,reported,, some of Trump’s more outlandish supporters and allies have advocated for antidemocratic maneuvers to seize control of the White House. Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn ,called, for a Myanmar-style military coup at a QAnon conference late last month (he has since walked back the comments). ,“Lara Trump Dismisses Reports Trump Believes He Will Be Reinstated In August” ,(Forbes) ,“Maggie Haberman: Trump Telling People He Expects To Be ‘Reinstated’ As President By August”, (Forbes) ,“Trump Says GOP Will Retake Congress, White House ‘Sooner Than You Think’ In Fundraising Video”, (Forbes)"

What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."
"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."

"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination.

The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."
"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
"3 In 10 Republicans Believe Wacky Conspiracy Theory Trump Will Be ‘Reinstated’ As President This Year, Poll Shows","While most Americans dismiss the possibility, a significant chunk of Republicans believe the conspiracy theory buoyed by some of Donald Trump’s allies (and, reportedly, believed by the former president himself) that he’ll be back in the White House by the end of the year, a poll published Wednesday suggests. ,Former U.S. President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower in Manhattan on May 18, 2021 in New York City. ,... [+], ,The ,Politico,/Morning Consult ,survey, of 1,990 registered voters found respondents were broadly dismissive of the notion Trump could be “reinstated” as president. ,A decisive majority (72%) across the political spectrum deemed it “not very likely” or “not likely at all” Trump will have his old job by the end of the year. ,However, self-identified Republicans were less quick to dismiss the conspiracy theory. ,While 61% of GOP respondents labeled Trump’s return unlikely, some 29% said they believe he will be made president again. ,This compares to 84% of the Democrats surveyed who said Trump won’t be reinstated and 13% who said he will be. ,All in all, 19% of the people surveyed for the poll said it was either “somewhat likely” or “very likely” Trump will be reinstated as president this year. ,The conspiracy theory Trump will be reinstated as president, which has become popular among ,QAnon believers,, stems from the false claims still being pushed by some Republicans that the 2020 election was rigged. Trump has ,reportedly, become fixated with the ongoing GOP-commissioned election audit in Arizona and is pushing for similar ballot reviews across the country, telling allies (though daughter-in-law Lara Trump has since ,denied, this) the success of the recounts could result in his return to the White House this year. Of course, election officials across the country have maintained that last year’s presidential election was one of the safest in history and have denied the possibility it was marred by widespread fraud. ,As ,Forbes, has previously ,reported,, some of Trump’s more outlandish supporters and allies have advocated for antidemocratic maneuvers to seize control of the White House. Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn ,called, for a Myanmar-style military coup at a QAnon conference late last month (he has since walked back the comments). ,“Lara Trump Dismisses Reports Trump Believes He Will Be Reinstated In August” ,(Forbes) ,“Maggie Haberman: Trump Telling People He Expects To Be ‘Reinstated’ As President By August”, (Forbes) ,“Trump Says GOP Will Retake Congress, White House ‘Sooner Than You Think’ In Fundraising Video”, (Forbes)"
"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."
Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,... [+], (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization.

BTS Now Claim The Three Largest Streaming Weeks In The History Of Billboard’s Global Chart,"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - FEBRUARY 21: (L-R) J-Hope, SUGA, Jungkook, Jimin, RM, V, and Jin of the K-pop ,... [+], boy band BTS visit the ""Today"" Show at Rockefeller Plaza on February 21, 2020 in New York City. (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images),BTS control the Billboard Global 200 chart once again this week, as their new single “Butter” doesn’t move an inch. The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world. As the division within the SEC highlights, trade offs are often framed as being between encouraging innovation and investment or implementing stringent regulatory safeguards.

The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."
Kim Kardashian West Is Officially A Billionaire," Kim Kardashian,W,hen Kim Kardashian West was first mentioned in the pages of ,Forbes, in 2011, it was simply a tally of her Twitter followers: 6.6 million, just below Barack Obama and just above Ashton Kutcher. Five years later, she graced the ,cover, of ,Forbes, thanks to her booming mobile game, which helped her earn $51 million that year. Now, she officially joins the World’s Billionaires list for the first time.,Forbes ,estimates that Kardashian West is now worth $1 billion, up from $780 million in October, thanks to two lucrative businesses—KKW Beauty and Skims—as well as cash from reality television and endorsement deals, and a number of smaller investments.,Kardashian West founded KKW Beauty in 2017, following the success of her half-sister Kylie Jenner’s Kylie Cosmetics. She borrowed from Kylie’s playbook, using a similar direct-to-consumer model that relies heavily on social media marketing. Her first launch, 300,000 contour kits, ,sold out within two hours,. By 2018, the business had expanded into eyeshadows, concealers, lipsticks and fragrances, and was bringing in about ,$100 million in revenue.,""It’s the first time I've moved away from having licensing deals and transitioned into being an owner,"" Kardashian West told ,Forbes, in 2017, when she announced her cosmetics line.,She cashed in on that ownership last year when she sold 20% of KKW Beauty to cosmetics conglomerate Coty for $200 million, a deal that valued the company at $1 billion. While ,Forbes, estimates that figure is a little bloated—Coty, which also bought 51% of Kylie Cosmetics in 2020, is known for overpaying—her remaining 72% stake is still worth about $500 million, by our count.,Then there’s Skims, the shapewear line Kardashian West launched in 2019. She raised money from fashion insiders like Net-a-Porter’s Natalie Massane and Theory’s Andrew Rosen, and capitalized on her massive social media following to shill the brand. (She now has 69.6 million Twitter followers and 213 million followers on Instagram.) Skims has been quick on its feet: During the pandemic, when consumers became more interested in comfy clothes for the couch than in smoothing their stomachs under evening gowns, she swiftly started turning the focus to loungewear.,Kardashian West owns a majority stake in closely-held Skims, which hasn’t disclosed its revenues. A source familiar with Skims told ,Forbes ,about a transaction that values the shapewear company north of $500 million. As a result, ,Forbes, estimates her Skims stake is worth a conservative $225 million, enough to lift her fortune to $1 billion.,The rest of Kardashian West’s fortune sits in cash and investments, including real estate. Every year since 2012, she has earned at least $10 million pretax, by ,Forbes’, count, thanks to paychecks from ,Keeping Up With the Kardashians, ,endorsement deals and endeavors like the aforementioned mobile game and her now-defunct Kimoji app. She’s also got three properties in Calabasas, northwest of Los Angeles, and a portfolio of blue-chip investments, including shares of Disney, Amazon, Netflix and Adidas that her soon-to-be ex-husband Kanye West gifted her for Christmas in 2017. ,But it’s the companies that she has launched herself, and grown with the typical Kardashian flare for self-promotion, that land her on the World’s Billionaires list. As she tweeted the day she made the cover of ,Forbes,, mocking the criticism she’s received for years: “Not bad for a girl with no talent.”"
Uber Veteran Launches Her ‘AI Mindset’ Self-Driving Startup With $83.5 Million Round,"Waabi founder and CEO Raquel Urtasun, a computer scientist and University of Toronto professor, sees a new path to commercializing self-driving technology.,Computer scientist Raquel Urtasun, an artificial intelligence expert who led a team of Toronto-based engineers for Uber’s self-driving vehicle program, is launching tech startup Waabi with an $83.5 million funding round and a new “AI mindset” approach to commercializing automated driving.,The Series A round, among the biggest for any Canadian tech startup, is led by Khosla Ventures and includes investment from Uber, Radical Ventures, 8VC, OMERS Ventures and BDC Capital’s Women in Technology Venture Fund. Aurora Innovation, the self-driving tech company that ,acquired Uber ATG last December,, is a minority investor. AI experts including Stanford University’s Fei-Fei Li, the University of Toronto’s Geoffrey Hinton and Sanja Fidler and the University of California, Berkeley’s Pieter Abbeel also participated in the round. ,The initial application of its technology is automating long-haul trucks, though it’s not saying when that might begin. Waabi isn’t disclosing a company valuation based on the Series A, nor is it saying who will sit on its board. ,The company (whose name is inspired by an Ojibwe word meaning “she has vision”) aims to set itself apart from companies that have raised billions of dollars, such as Waymo, Cruise, Zoox, Argo AI, TuSimple and Aurora, by relying heavily on cutting-edge AI tools and less of what Urtasun calls a traditional “robotics mindset.” The latter requires vastly more data, solving an almost endless list of tasks and incalculable miles of on-road driving to train the software. ,Waabi CEO Raquel Urtasun was previously chief scientist and head of Uber ATG's Toronto unit.,Waabi’s approach relies on a “new generation of AI algorithms that combine deep learning, probabilistic inference and complex optimization” that makes it possible to “generalize and learn from a small amount of data,” Urtasun says. Her company has also developed a closed-loop computer simulation system to test and train the driving software that, ideally, will be applicable in multiple geographies. ,“You end up with an approach that requires much less to actually develop. It’s much less capital-intensive and doesn't require this driving and driving and driving on the road. You get much more automated, fast-paced solutions, and with the ability to come up with much more complex systems,” she says. ,The Spanish native’s startup arrives amid a period of consolidation within the autonomous driving industry, a major management change at Waymo and growing uncertainty about exactly how soon robotaxis, self-driving trucks and autonomous urban delivery vehicles will be ready for wide-scale deployment. With the creation of Waabi, Urtasun also becomes the third woman to lead a self-driving tech company, joining Zoox CEO Aicha Evans and ,Tekedra Mawakana, Waymo’s new co-CEO,.,When ,Uber hired Urtasun in May 2017, as a chief scientist to lead a tech hub in Toronto, where she is also a professor of computer science at the University of Toronto, former CEO Travis Kalanick called her “one of the world’s leading researchers in the fields of machine perception and artificial intelligence.” (Urtasun also recently served as a judge for Forbes’ ,AI 50 2021: America’s Most Promising Artificial Intelligence Companies,.),""Raquel is truly one-of-a-kind—a tenacious and inspiring leader who empowers those around her to excel,” said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi.,“Not everything in consolidation is good. One of the problems is that you have less and less diversity of approach.” ,Sven Strohband, managing director at Khosla Ventures, said “with a dream team that has been at the forefront of innovation in the industry and a differentiated, AI-first approach, Waabi is well-positioned to lead the next generation of self-driving technology.” ,Arriving at a period of industry consolidation—and some frustration with the overall pace of development—is “exactly the right time to start a company,” says Urtasun.,“We've seen a lot of consolidation and that makes sense when you have a very capital intensive approach. But not everything in consolidation is good. One of the problems is that you have less and less diversity of approach,” she says. “If you’re trying to solve such a difficult problem as self-driving, and you're all going with a single approach, chances of really solving this are much smaller than if you try to solve it with a diverse set of approaches.”"
Smart-Lock Startup Latch Rides SPAC Frenzy To $1.5 Billion Valuation,"Smart-lock maker Latch began trading on Monday.,Smart-lock startup Latch began trading Monday through a SPAC listing that raised $453 million and values the company at over $1.5 billion. The shares, issued through a special purpose acquisition vehicle run by Tishman Speyer Properties, rose 4% on the first day of trading. ,“Using the Tishman Speyer portfolio as an incubator for new ideas and new products...was really just too good to pass up,” says Latch’s cofounder and CEO, Luke Schoenfelder, who made the Forbes Under 30 ,list, in 2018.,Latch, which had revenue of just $18 million last year, was founded in 2013 and is best known for its smart-locks, which can be unlocked with a smartphone. Schoenfelder, 32, and his cofounders stumbled on the concept after trying to solve a simpler problem: “How do you run out of orange juice in the morning and have a fresh carton delivered directly into your refrigerator at the end of the day?” Latch’s CFO Garth Mitchell told ,Forbes ,earlier this year. ,The team realized that property access was the first hurdle to executing that concept, and soon homed in on the smart-lock market. They targeted residential properties at the outset, since the potential to scale was so much higher than commercial businesses.,Latch was valued at more than $400 million after its Series B round raised $126 million in 2019, when one-in-ten new multi-family projects across the U.S. utilized its technology. The company says it will use the new funding to expand into Europe and grow new business segments in the commercial space. A year ago, when offices shuttered and renters fled from major cities, things looked far more grim. “We had to make some tough choices in the spring to bring our burn down,” Mitchell says.,Now rental demand ,is rebounding, in many urban areas and commercial landlords are eyeing the return of workers to offices, while new safety protocols have made contactless entry systems more appealing. Latch launched Visitor Express, a contactless system for offices, in early 2021. Overall it says its products have been purchased or reserved in over 300,000 units across the country, mainly residential. Revenue has risen from under $15 million in 2019 to $18 million last year, according to public filings, but losses have also swelled, from $50 million to $66 million. ,The company followed many of its peers to market through a SPAC listing, which allows firms to skirt the scrutiny of a traditional initial public offering, including wading through some regulatory requirements and conducting roadshows that allow potential investors to question executives about opportunities and risks. ,SPACs provide a faster way to market by taking a publicly traded shell company (the SPAC) and merging it with a target business like Latch. Investors in the shell company generally take large fees, creating a ,no-lose opportunity, for many of their backers and a much riskier scenario for less sophisticated retail investors who are drawn to the hype.,Latch and its peers are now bellwethers for those risks, says Howard Schilit, author of ,Financial Shenanigans,. Porch and Opendoor have already gone public through SPACs, while WeWork, Better, Sonder and Offerpad are planning listings to do so. And it’s not limited to real estate. PWC cited the “continued SPAC attack” as the driver behind 389 IPOs completed in the ,first quarter, of the year that raised a total of $125 billion.,“There always have been successful SPACs, despite the fact that on average SPACs have never been a good investment for public shareholders,” says Michael Klausner, the Nancy and Charles Munger Professor of Business at Stanford Law School. He adds that “the SPAC bubble seems to be deflating. One never knows when a bubble will burst or fully deflate, but I think a reasonable inference from the market is that the deflation process is happening.”,Schoenfelder, for his part, insists that Latch would have gone public with or without a SPAC bubble, noting the multiple merger offers he fielded. ,“If you look at the institutional investors that participated in our transaction...Fidelity, BlackRock, Wellington,” he says, “I think there would have been appetite in lots of different permutations.”"
The Future Of Real Estate: Fintech 50 2021,"Four financial technology companies that are revolutionizing the real estate market made the Forbes Fintech 50 2021 list.,From the abyss of an economy-stopping global pandemic, the U.S. real estate market has emerged as arguably the hottest market in the world. Low interest rates and a future of working from home, or at least more flexible office arrangements, caused many Americans to relocate to suburban areas with lower costs and a higher quality of life. The pandemic-driven shifts ignited a residential housing boom and novel financial technology played a huge role in the surging market. ,Among private technology companies, startups targeting the inefficiencies and headaches of the real estate market are surging in value and growing at staggering rates. The process of getting a mortgage has long been considered a tedious slog of paperwork, and there have been few innovations to introduce young Americans to home ownership since the advent of the mortgage bond. ,Well-funded startups, including the four on the latest Forbes ,Fintech 50 list,, have stepped up to address this demand, with innovative technology that’s simplifying and opening the real estate market to a new generation. Our Fintech 50 list highlights companies like Blend Labs, with its white-label software that ,allows mortgages at some of America’s biggest banks to be done in just a few clicks,, and Divvy Homes, a landlord that wants to help its tenants become owners. These companies are using technology to redesign the experience of buying, selling and owning property.,Overall, through the use of new technology, there has never been lower friction to buying a home and the transaction costs across the market have plummeted. The pandemic-plagued year also was an opportunity for some innovative former Fintech 50 list members to join public stock markets, including Opendoor Technologies, a so-called iBuyer of homes that ,went public in December 2020, and now carries a $10 billion valuation.,Here are the financial technology companies revolutionizing the real estate market that made the Forbes Fintech 50 in 2021, including a brief description of what they do, who their users are and how much they’re worth.,Blend Labs' CEO and cofounder Nima Ghamsari.

How An Ex-Semipro Poker Player Bet Big And Won The $4.3 Trillion Mortgage Market,"Hot Hand: Nima Ghamsari in the Beverly Hills home where he has worked during the pandemic as his business exploded and his software powered nearly a third of the U.S. mortgage market. ,A,mong, ,the big surprises of the pandemic economy was the housing boom. As fleeing city dwellers and cramped work-from-home families bid up the price of spacious suburban homes, rock-bottom interest rates enticed existing homeowners to refinance in record numbers. By the end of last year, 13.6 million mortgages worth $4.3 trillion had been closed, shattering the previous all-time record of $3.7 trillion in 2003., ,It was a miraculous feat, considering that most of that lending was done while in-person meetings were taboo and overworked loan officers operated from ad hoc home offices as their dogs barked and children fidgeted through remote classes. ,Truth is, the mortgage market probably would have melted down were, ,it not for a secret weapon: Nima Ghamsari, a 35-year-old Iranian immigrant who made hundreds of thousands of dollars playing poker online while at Stanford; joined secretive big-data startup Palantir Technologies upon graduation; and then, at just 26, quit that dream job to start his own software company, Blend Labs, in 2012. “I have always felt like I wanted to bet on myself. I’m willing to take a lot of risk,” he says matter-of-factly.,""Venture capitalists doubted us. I can’t even count how many times I’ve heard them say, ‘This will never work,’ or ‘[banks] won’t actually use it,’ ” Ghamsari recalls. ,Though invisible to ordinary borrowers and comparatively low-profile in its Silicon Valley home, Blend has had a staggering impact. It now provides digital infrastructure to 287 U.S. banks, including such big mortgage lenders as Wells Fargo and First Republic Bank. In 2020, Blend software was used to process $1.4 trillion in mortgage and consumer loans, up nearly threefold from the prior year. Its staff grew to 750 from 425 before the pandemic. Blend’s revenue doubled last year to about $100 million, ,Forbes, estimates. ,Thanks in no small part to Blend, the mortgage application, underwriting and closing process—once a weeks- or months-long slog of paperwork, emails, faxes and phone calls—can now be done almost entirely digitally. Blend saves an average of 7.3 days and $520 in operational costs per loan and allows a typical banker to close 14 mortgages a month, consultancy MarketWise Advisors estimates. Blend seamlessly integrates with CoreLogic for credit scores, Plaid to check on bank, ,accounts and Google Maps for location data. This enables some banks to offer home hunters quick tentative mortgage approvals with a few mouse clicks—a huge, ,plus in a white-hot housing market.,“We all got stressed last year with the crush of volume,” says Tom Wind, president of US Bank Home Mortgage, one of Blend’s largest customers. “We were able to serve more customers last year because of efficiencies we have with Blend.” In 2020, US Bank saw a 136% increase in mortgage fee revenue without having to increase staff. ,Ghamsari and Blend have produced results by bucking convention on Sand Hill Road. Instead of seeking to disrupt the banks (a common fintech goal), he decided to retrofit them, charging for the service. His rationale: He wouldn’t have to waste time and money on consumer marketing and could potentially make financial services easier to access for 100 million consumers instead of maybe a million or two.,In January, fresh off its banner year, Blend raised $300 million from blue-chip investors including Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global and Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management at a $3.3 billion valuation, doubling its worth in a span of five months. In April, Blend filed confidential documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a possible initial public offering, which (given that Blend has an incentive-laden compensation structure similar to Tesla’s) could launch Ghamsari on the road to billionaire status—if Blend performs well. There are whispers that SPACs have shown interest in merging with Blend at double its latest valuation, though Ghamsari won’t comment. ,Blend is a standout on this year’s ,Forbes’, ,Fintech 50,, which celebrates private startups transforming financial services. Twenty of the Fintech 50 ,are new this year,, reflecting the energy and record venture capital pouring into the sector, the impact of Covid-19 and the fact that ,seven of last year’s picks,, including crypto exchange Coinbase and Opendoor Technologies, which buys homes quickly for cash, have since gone public. Counting Blend, at least four current members of the Fintech 50 are considering listing on the public markets. ,Yet few have had so much impact on ordinary folks’ lives. Since the end of World War II, owning a home has been at the center of the American Dream—as it was for Ghamsari’s own family. He moved to the U.S. from Iran in 1987 when he was a year old, as his parents pursued graduate studies at the University of Michigan and then settled down in Cincinnati, where his dad taught math at the University of Cincinnati and his mother taught chemistry at Xavier University. After years of renting, Ghamsari’s parents were finally, ,approved in 1998 for a low-down-payment mortgage and purchased a no-frills two-story home in Cincinnati for about $100,000. It was the rock their family prospered upon. They later became franchisees of a tutoring company, employing their brainy teenage son to grade and tutor students. ,That wasn’t the only way the ambitious Ghamsari kept busy before graduating from high school first in his class. He worked at McDonald’s, Starbucks and Circuit City, rebuilt Dell computers and taught himself to code. At Stanford, a need-based scholarship helped cover tuition, but Ghamsari tried his hand at online poker to help pay for living expenses. Soon, when he wasn’t studying, he was playing day and night, with his winnings extending well into the six figures. “It was my first taste of something where, if I really put a lot of energy and effort into getting better, how good the outcomes could be over a very long run,” he says.,To make more time for poker, Ghamsari bought a gas-powered golf cart to get around Stanford’s sprawling 8,000-acre campus faster. “I really optimize my time around doing the things that I want to do. I try to make everything that I don’t want to do be as efficient—ideally nonexistent—as possible,’’ he explains. (Stealing a page from Steve Jobs’ playbook, he has 30 black T-shirts, he says, because “I don’t like spending time thinking about what I’m going to wear.”) ,Ghamsari’s vision is hardly modest. He argues that software can eliminate tens of billions of dollars a year of unneeded friction in the financial system. “In 10 years, finance is going to be truly digital and proactive in real time.’’ ,With little regard for the brilliant undergraduate’s precious time, campus police impounded Ghamsari’s forbidden golf cart. “It was totally obnoxious for me to have, in retrospect,’’ he concedes. No matter. By the time he graduated with a computer science degree in 2008, he had bought an Aston Martin and been recruited by the ultra-secretive big-data startup Palantir Technologies, originally funded by the CIA’s venture arm. He was assigned to Palantir’s push to deploy its software inside America’s then-teetering big banks, whose patchwork, decades-old technology infrastructure gave them a poor grasp of their problematic mortgage exposures. Ghamsari saw up close the massive opportunity to disrupt banks—or to transform them.,“The insight Palantir had was that there was this immense growth in the amount of data being captured by organizations, but there was no way to harness that data for operational things,” he says. “You had to literally read pieces of paper, because all the data in the mortgage industry at the time was done in an analog way.” ,Like other employees, Ghamsari had stock options and could have, ,cashed in when Palantir eventually, ,went public in 2020. Instead, in 2012, he and two other young colleagues (former quant trader Rosco Hill and engineer Eugene Marinelli) founded Blend together with Erin Collard, the head trader of billionaire Peter Thiel’s hedge fund, Clarium Capital, to bring new cloud-based technology to the earthbound banks. They gained early backing from Thiel and Max Levchin, now, ,worth $1.4 billion thanks to his newly public fintech, Affirm, which allows people to pay for items in installments. The four founders first worked out of Ghamsari’s cramped San Francisco apartment, until his roommates complained. So they rented a Mission Bay apartment, which they used as offices, hauling sleeping bags into closets for naps during round-the-clock coding sessions.,At first, venture capitalists, focused on fast, disruptive growth, were skeptical of Blend’s approach. Winning business from stodgy banks was uncertain, they warned, and there were only so many banks to sell to. “Venture, ,capitalists doubted us. I can’t even count how many times I’ve heard them say, ‘This will never work,’ or ‘[banks] won’t actually use it,’ ” Ghamsari recalls. ,But changes in the mortgage market eventually played into Ghamsari’s hands. In an effort to cut risk after the 2008 financial crisis, large lenders like Bank of America and Wells Fargo started offloading hundreds of billions in mortgages to third-party servicers. Those servicers needed help managing their massive new portfolios and were more open to getting it from young tech wizards than banks might have been. Early Blend customers included Nationstar Mortgage (now Mr. Cooper), the country’s third-largest mortgage servicer.,Blend’s big break, however, came courtesy of a competitor. In 2015, Dan Gilbert, the Quicken Loans billionaire, launched Rocket Mortgage, which cut mortgage closing times from over 40 days to just a month—similar to what Blend was offering. “Every bank’s board woke up and said, ‘Oh, my God, we need to find a solution to compete with this, because if we don’t, we’re going to lose volume to Rocket.’ Blend was one of those answers,” recalls Jeffrey Reitman, a partner at Blend investor Canapi Ventures. ,Through the first half of 2017, Blend, ,received just $67 million in outside funding. But after VCs saw it had won Wells Fargo, US Bank and mortgage originator Movement Mortgage as customers, they started calling. In August 2017, Blend raised $100 million at a half-billion-dollar valuation in a round led by Greylock with Emergence Capital, 8VC, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Nyca Partners. ,With that cash, Ghamsari was able to add hundreds of smaller banks as customers. He also expanded functionality, giving borrowers the ability to upload documents and banks the ability to manage more of the closing process, as well as the applications process, digitally. In 2019, Blend raised a further $130 million and hired Tim Mayopoulos, the now 62-year-old former CEO of Fannie Mae, as its president, giving it instant credibility with banks and government-backed mortgage finance agencies, known in the trade as GSEs. Ghamsari “came and visited me in my office, and he was this scruffy guy in a black T-shirt,’’ Mayopoulos recalls. “But it was clear that he had the same vision about how the system ought to work that I did: It should all be driven by reliable data that gets shared with all the key participants in the process, from the consumer to the lender to the ultimate holder of the credit risk [the GSEs].”,Blend isn’t stopping at mortgages—or banks. By 2019, it had launched paper-reducing software, ,for, ,homeowner’s insurance and home-equity and auto loans. It’s also enabling homebuilder Lennar to offer mortgages. In March, it agreed to acquire title-insurance and settlement company Title365 for $422 million, with the aim of integrating even more of the home closing process into its services—and collecting insurance fees. ,Ghamsari’s vision is hardly modest. He argues that software can eliminate tens of billions of dollars a year of unneeded friction in the financial system. “In 10 years, finance is going to be truly digital and proactive in real time,’’ he says. Consumers will open an app and get real-time recommendations, based on their individual financial picture, with Blend powering it all. If that happens, he adds, “This will be one of the biggest companies in the world.”"
Kanye West’s Yeezy Gap Launch Isn’t Sold Out. But It’s Still Good News For The Billionaire’s Fortune,"Kanye West announced his Yeezy Gap collaboration last year, causing a surge the retailer's ,... [+], share-price. ,Yeezy Gap, Kanye West’s much-awaited line with the retailer, is finally here—and it’s already flying off the shelves. ,On Tuesday, West’s 44th birthday, a $200 blue nylon, unisex puffer jacket dubbed the “RoundJacket” became available to preorder. Within a few hours, the jacket, which will ship this fall, had seemingly sold out. A spokesperson for Yeezy Gap said that the jacket was still available to pre-order, but due to high demand, customers were seeing a “sold out” message.,If the success of the jacket’s launch is any indication of how well Yeezy Gap will do, West stands to make a fortune from the 10-year partnership, which entitles him to royalty payments based on sales. West may also get up to 8.5 million shares of Gap stock if the line hits certain sales goals, a deal that could add tens of millions of dollars to West’s fortune based on the current stock price.,The Yeezy partnership has already been a win for Gap’s stock. When the deal was announced last June, Gap shares ,surged nearly 40%,. As of noon Tuesday, the company’s stock had risen 2.5% from the previous day. ,West is currently worth $1.8 billion, by ,Forbes,’ estimates, with the bulk of that attributed to his Yeezy sneaker line The collection pulled in an estimated $1.7 billion in revenue in 2020 through its partnership with Adidas—earning West $191 million in royalties last year. The rest of his fortune is made up of his music catalogue (worth an estimated $90 million), his stake in soon-to-be ex-wife Kim Kardashian West’s shapewear company Skims (worth an estimated $64 million) and a handful of other assets, including cash, real estate, jewelry and even livestock (worth an estimated $160 million). ,While bank documents ,Forbes ,saw earlier this year suggested Yeezy Gap was worth as much as $1.5 billion based on future projected earnings, ,Forbes ,declined to value the company, until it started to bring in revenue. With the first batch of Yeezy Gap apparel hitting the market—and demand proving high—it seems the world’s richest rapper is about to get even richer.,This story has been updated to reflect that the “sold out” message customers were seeing was a glitch due to high demand.,The first item in the Yeezy Gap collaboration, called the ""round jacket,"" sold out within hours."
Remote-Controlled Labs? Strateos Raises $56 Million To Build Out Its Vision Of Scientific Automation,"Strateos CEO Mark Fischer-Colbrie at the company's Menlo Park, California, lab.,A,fter Mark Fischer-Colbrie sold liquid-handling company Labcyte, where he’d been CEO for more than a decade, to a division of Danaher in 2019, he could have retired. But when Fischer-Colbrie, now 64, heard about the opportunity to become CEO of Strateos, a Menlo Park, California-based startup that develops remote-access labs and lab-control software for life sciences research, he signed on.,“I didn’t have to do this,” he says. “I could’ve gone off to do other things or not worked at all. But this is such a big opportunity to rethink how life sciences research is done.”,His vision: a worldwide network of these remote-controlled labs that could work with both chemistry and biology. Today, Strateos said that it had raised $56 million, led by DCVC and Lux Capital, to build out that vision. The new investment brings Strateos’ total funding to around $90 million at an estimated valuation of $200 million.,“The sophistication of Strateos’ software and robotics make it possible to command, copy and modify complex experiments, run them in parallel and deliver insights and results, in many cases exponentially faster and at dramatically lower cost,” says Matt Ocko, a managing partner at DCVC, who first invested in the company back at the seed round.,Back in 2012, Max Hodak founded Strateos’ ,predecessor company, Transcriptic,, straight out of college at Duke University. Hodak had already built and sold a previous startup, called MyFit, which focused on helping students identify the right colleges. But as a student researcher, he grew frustrated with the amount of wasted time in the lab and the difficulties scientists have doing what are essentially detailed, robotic processes like transferring minuscule amounts of liquid. With Transcriptic, he developed a robotic cloud laboratory platform for life sciences research.,In 2019, Transcriptic merged with 3Scan, which uses automation, machine learning and computer vision to extract spatial data from tissue samples and create detailed 3-D representations. The merged company, named Strateos, hired Fischer-Colbrie as its new CEO. Fischer-Colbrie, who competes in Ironman and Half Ironman triathlons (“Just to stay in shape,” he says), had previously helped take three companies public before becoming CEO of Labcyte. “Mark is the antithesis of the preening rock star CEO,” Ocko says.,“This represents a real shift to flexible automation and industrialization. Labs should be thought of as data engines.” ,Deep tech like this is hard, and the company has largely been under the radar as it built the software and began to deploy it. Last year, it unveiled its first 11,500-square-foot remote-access lab in San Diego, in conjunction with pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, to accelerate drug discovery. It also has a smaller lab in Menlo Park, California, and has signed on some 100 customers, including biotech firms like Amgen and Abbvie, synthetic biology company Ginkgo Bioworks and the federal Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, for projects or software.,Historically, Fischer-Colbrie says, scientific labs have been “shockingly poor” at getting good data, which has slowed down their research efforts. “A lot of life sciences is done 1850s-style,” he says. “It takes a long time and it costs a lot.”,Strateos’ software, by contrast, can combine robotic machinery together in automated modules and allow researchers to run their labs from anywhere. At Strateos, Fischer-Colbrie figures there’s an opportunity to increase revenue from tens of millions today (he declines to be more exact) to hundreds of millions as the company deploys its labs worldwide. “This represents a real shift to flexible automation and industrialization,” he says. “Labs should be thought of as data engines.” ,In a video tour of the sprawling San Diego lab, the gleaming equipment of 23 robotic modules connected with a giant automated track, looks more like a chip foundry. With Strateos, users log on to a Web app and the software guides the experiments, determining where the robotic arms should move the materials or what temperature and pressure a reactor should use. Strateos now runs the lab and can offer its capacity to customers beyond Lilly, using privacy controls in the software to keep different customers’ experiments and data separate. Scale? The facility is capable of doing 190,000 experiments per day. “When you are inside this building, you feel like you are in a silicon wafer foundry or a data center,” says Ben Miles, Strateos’ head of product. “There’s the hum of the HVAC going, and all these robots doing everything in the module.”,The combination of better data and more automation should speed up drug discovery and advances in synthetic biology. A new therapeutic might take 60 cycles of variations, Fischer-Colbrie says, and if each one takes weeks or months, that adds up to years of discovery work. “We think we can cut that time in half at least, and that’s before you add in the AI tools. That’s just raw speed and data reliability,” he says. ,Fischer-Colbrie ultimately envisions scores of these giant automated labs across the globe, including in Europe and Asia. The company is currently in talks with potential partners to open a lab on the East Coast, he says, though those plans remain at the discussion stage. In an even earlier stage is the company’s technology for tissue sampling. “If you can accelerate discovery,” he says, “you can go after medium or small markets, or even rare disease areas, economically.”"
"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."

Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh).

"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination.

The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
The World’s Richest Sports Team Owners 2021,"Mukesh Ambani, Steve Ballmer,I,t has been an ascendant 12 months for India’s richest person, Mukesh Ambani. His cricket team, the Mumbai Indians, were Indian Premier League champions for the second year in a row. And off the field, shares of his multinational conglomerate, Reliance Industries, rose more than 85% over the last 12 months—helping more than double Ambani’s net worth to $84.5 billion.,That’s enough to make Ambani the world’s richest sports team owner. He surpasses last year’s No. 1, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, for the top spot.,Ballmer, who owns the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, has also seen his fortune grow, although not enough to keep up with Ambani. His net worth is now $68.7 billion, according to ,Forbes,, up from $52.7 billion a year ago. ,The bar for entry onto the list of the richest sports team owners has gotten dramatically higher since early 2020, amid what has been a record year for billionaire wealth. The top 20 billionaire controlling owners of teams in major sports leagues now have a combined net worth of $427 billion, up from ,$266 billion last year,, according to ,Forbes,. That’s a 60% increase over the past 12 months—even though many sports arenas and stadiums have remained mostly empty amid the pandemic.,Of course, Covid-19 hasn’t curbed fans’ appetite or stopped major deals from happening. Hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen, for example, finally won approval from Major League Baseball for his roughly $2.4 billion purchase of the New York Mets in October 2020. That deal has earned Cohen a spot on the list of the world’s richest sports team owners for the first time.,Another notable newcomer: billionaire Home Depot cofounder Arthur Blank. After stepping down as co-chairman of the retail giant in 2001, he purchased the Atlanta Falcons football team the following year for $545 million (now ,worth, nearly $1.9 billion net of debt, according to ,Forbes,’ estimates). Blank also brought professional soccer to the city with his Major League Soccer team Atlanta United FC, which played its inaugural season in 2017. ,The biggest gainer on the list this year—in both dollar and percentage terms—is, by far, Dan Gilbert, the billionaire mortgage tycoon and owner of the NBA’s Cleveland Cavaliers. He’s worth an estimated $51.9 billion, a nearly 700% increase from last year thanks to the company he cofounded in 1985, Quicken Loans. Now the largest mortgage lender in the United States, Quicken went public as Rocket Companies at a massive $36 billion valuation in August 2020, ,catapulting, Gilbert up the ranks of the world’s richest billionaires.,Dan Gilbert.,Dietrich Mateschitz.,Steve Cohen.,David Tepper.,Stanley Kroenke.,Arthur Blank.,Italian billionaire Rocco Commisso, owner of soccer team ACF Fiorentina, was added to the list at #16. That bumped Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons, to #21 on the list."
"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1?

Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world.

The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."

  ,ENB, 
 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."
"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."
New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."
Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."
Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."
"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Record For The Largest Sales Week Of 2021 With An Old Release,"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift attends the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los ,... [+], Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."
NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."
"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,... [+], (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."
Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."
"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."
BTS Now Claim The Three Largest Streaming Weeks In The History Of Billboard’s Global Chart,"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - FEBRUARY 21: (L-R) J-Hope, SUGA, Jungkook, Jimin, RM, V, and Jin of the K-pop ,...

(Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images),BTS control the Billboard Global 200 chart once again this week, as their new single “Butter” doesn’t move an inch. The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."
Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,...

Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world. As the division within the SEC highlights, trade offs are often framed as being between encouraging innovation and investment or implementing stringent regulatory safeguards.

New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."
Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."

  ,ENB, 
 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."
"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."

Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Record For The Largest Sales Week Of 2021 With An Old Release,"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift attends the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los ,... [+], Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."
Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."

"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination.

"3 In 10 Republicans Believe Wacky Conspiracy Theory Trump Will Be ‘Reinstated’ As President This Year, Poll Shows","While most Americans dismiss the possibility, a significant chunk of Republicans believe the conspiracy theory buoyed by some of Donald Trump’s allies (and, reportedly, believed by the former president himself) that he’ll be back in the White House by the end of the year, a poll published Wednesday suggests. ,Former U.S. President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower in Manhattan on May 18, 2021 in New York City. ,... [+], ,The ,Politico,/Morning Consult ,survey, of 1,990 registered voters found respondents were broadly dismissive of the notion Trump could be “reinstated” as president. ,A decisive majority (72%) across the political spectrum deemed it “not very likely” or “not likely at all” Trump will have his old job by the end of the year. ,However, self-identified Republicans were less quick to dismiss the conspiracy theory. ,While 61% of GOP respondents labeled Trump’s return unlikely, some 29% said they believe he will be made president again. ,This compares to 84% of the Democrats surveyed who said Trump won’t be reinstated and 13% who said he will be. ,All in all, 19% of the people surveyed for the poll said it was either “somewhat likely” or “very likely” Trump will be reinstated as president this year. ,The conspiracy theory Trump will be reinstated as president, which has become popular among ,QAnon believers,, stems from the false claims still being pushed by some Republicans that the 2020 election was rigged. Trump has ,reportedly, become fixated with the ongoing GOP-commissioned election audit in Arizona and is pushing for similar ballot reviews across the country, telling allies (though daughter-in-law Lara Trump has since ,denied, this) the success of the recounts could result in his return to the White House this year. Of course, election officials across the country have maintained that last year’s presidential election was one of the safest in history and have denied the possibility it was marred by widespread fraud. ,As ,Forbes, has previously ,reported,, some of Trump’s more outlandish supporters and allies have advocated for antidemocratic maneuvers to seize control of the White House. Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn ,called, for a Myanmar-style military coup at a QAnon conference late last month (he has since walked back the comments). ,“Lara Trump Dismisses Reports Trump Believes He Will Be Reinstated In August” ,(Forbes) ,“Maggie Haberman: Trump Telling People He Expects To Be ‘Reinstated’ As President By August”, (Forbes) ,“Trump Says GOP Will Retake Congress, White House ‘Sooner Than You Think’ In Fundraising Video”, (Forbes)"
The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."
Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."
"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."
"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing.

"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world.

New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."
"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."
Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,...

Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"

The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."

 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."
"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."
Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."
Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"

"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."

Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination.

"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."

"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."
NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."
Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Record For The Largest Sales Week Of 2021 With An Old Release,"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift attends the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los ,... [+], Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."
Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."

The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."
Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,... [+], (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world.

Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Record For The Largest Sales Week Of 2021 With An Old Release,"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift attends the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los ,... [+], Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."
"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."

  ,ENB, 
 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."

He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."
Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."
"3 In 10 Republicans Believe Wacky Conspiracy Theory Trump Will Be ‘Reinstated’ As President This Year, Poll Shows","While most Americans dismiss the possibility, a significant chunk of Republicans believe the conspiracy theory buoyed by some of Donald Trump’s allies (and, reportedly, believed by the former president himself) that he’ll be back in the White House by the end of the year, a poll published Wednesday suggests. ,Former U.S. President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower in Manhattan on May 18, 2021 in New York City. ,... [+], ,The ,Politico,/Morning Consult ,survey, of 1,990 registered voters found respondents were broadly dismissive of the notion Trump could be “reinstated” as president. ,A decisive majority (72%) across the political spectrum deemed it “not very likely” or “not likely at all” Trump will have his old job by the end of the year. ,However, self-identified Republicans were less quick to dismiss the conspiracy theory. ,While 61% of GOP respondents labeled Trump’s return unlikely, some 29% said they believe he will be made president again. ,This compares to 84% of the Democrats surveyed who said Trump won’t be reinstated and 13% who said he will be. ,All in all, 19% of the people surveyed for the poll said it was either “somewhat likely” or “very likely” Trump will be reinstated as president this year. ,The conspiracy theory Trump will be reinstated as president, which has become popular among ,QAnon believers,, stems from the false claims still being pushed by some Republicans that the 2020 election was rigged. Trump has ,reportedly, become fixated with the ongoing GOP-commissioned election audit in Arizona and is pushing for similar ballot reviews across the country, telling allies (though daughter-in-law Lara Trump has since ,denied, this) the success of the recounts could result in his return to the White House this year. Of course, election officials across the country have maintained that last year’s presidential election was one of the safest in history and have denied the possibility it was marred by widespread fraud. ,As ,Forbes, has previously ,reported,, some of Trump’s more outlandish supporters and allies have advocated for antidemocratic maneuvers to seize control of the White House. Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn ,called, for a Myanmar-style military coup at a QAnon conference late last month (he has since walked back the comments). ,“Lara Trump Dismisses Reports Trump Believes He Will Be Reinstated In August” ,(Forbes) ,“Maggie Haberman: Trump Telling People He Expects To Be ‘Reinstated’ As President By August”, (Forbes) ,“Trump Says GOP Will Retake Congress, White House ‘Sooner Than You Think’ In Fundraising Video”, (Forbes)"

"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."

"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination.

"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."
The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."
NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."
Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."

The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world.

Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,... [+], (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."
"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."
Michigan Governor Whitmer's Pipeline Move Declares War On Aviation,"Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer introduces Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden to speak ,...

  ,ENB, 
 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."

New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."
Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."
"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."
"3 In 10 Republicans Believe Wacky Conspiracy Theory Trump Will Be ‘Reinstated’ As President This Year, Poll Shows","While most Americans dismiss the possibility, a significant chunk of Republicans believe the conspiracy theory buoyed by some of Donald Trump’s allies (and, reportedly, believed by the former president himself) that he’ll be back in the White House by the end of the year, a poll published Wednesday suggests. ,Former U.S. President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower in Manhattan on May 18, 2021 in New York City. ,... [+], ,The ,Politico,/Morning Consult ,survey, of 1,990 registered voters found respondents were broadly dismissive of the notion Trump could be “reinstated” as president. ,A decisive majority (72%) across the political spectrum deemed it “not very likely” or “not likely at all” Trump will have his old job by the end of the year. ,However, self-identified Republicans were less quick to dismiss the conspiracy theory. ,While 61% of GOP respondents labeled Trump’s return unlikely, some 29% said they believe he will be made president again. ,This compares to 84% of the Democrats surveyed who said Trump won’t be reinstated and 13% who said he will be. ,All in all, 19% of the people surveyed for the poll said it was either “somewhat likely” or “very likely” Trump will be reinstated as president this year. ,The conspiracy theory Trump will be reinstated as president, which has become popular among ,QAnon believers,, stems from the false claims still being pushed by some Republicans that the 2020 election was rigged. Trump has ,reportedly, become fixated with the ongoing GOP-commissioned election audit in Arizona and is pushing for similar ballot reviews across the country, telling allies (though daughter-in-law Lara Trump has since ,denied, this) the success of the recounts could result in his return to the White House this year. Of course, election officials across the country have maintained that last year’s presidential election was one of the safest in history and have denied the possibility it was marred by widespread fraud. ,As ,Forbes, has previously ,reported,, some of Trump’s more outlandish supporters and allies have advocated for antidemocratic maneuvers to seize control of the White House. Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn ,called, for a Myanmar-style military coup at a QAnon conference late last month (he has since walked back the comments). ,“Lara Trump Dismisses Reports Trump Believes He Will Be Reinstated In August” ,(Forbes) ,“Maggie Haberman: Trump Telling People He Expects To Be ‘Reinstated’ As President By August”, (Forbes) ,“Trump Says GOP Will Retake Congress, White House ‘Sooner Than You Think’ In Fundraising Video”, (Forbes)"

As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."
"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination.

Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."
Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."
"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."
"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."
The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world.

[+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,... [+], (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."
"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."
Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."
"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."

  ,ENB, 
 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."

"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Record For The Largest Sales Week Of 2021 With An Old Release,"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift attends the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los ,... [+], Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."

"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W.

With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."
"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."
Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."
Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."
Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."
"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination.

The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,... [+], (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world.

Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."

(Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images),BTS control the Billboard Global 200 chart once again this week, as their new single “Butter” doesn’t move an inch. The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."

 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."
"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."
Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."

Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Record For The Largest Sales Week Of 2021 With An Old Release,"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift attends the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los ,... [+], Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."
"3 In 10 Republicans Believe Wacky Conspiracy Theory Trump Will Be ‘Reinstated’ As President This Year, Poll Shows","While most Americans dismiss the possibility, a significant chunk of Republicans believe the conspiracy theory buoyed by some of Donald Trump’s allies (and, reportedly, believed by the former president himself) that he’ll be back in the White House by the end of the year, a poll published Wednesday suggests. ,Former U.S. President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower in Manhattan on May 18, 2021 in New York City. ,... [+], ,The ,Politico,/Morning Consult ,survey, of 1,990 registered voters found respondents were broadly dismissive of the notion Trump could be “reinstated” as president. ,A decisive majority (72%) across the political spectrum deemed it “not very likely” or “not likely at all” Trump will have his old job by the end of the year. ,However, self-identified Republicans were less quick to dismiss the conspiracy theory. ,While 61% of GOP respondents labeled Trump’s return unlikely, some 29% said they believe he will be made president again. ,This compares to 84% of the Democrats surveyed who said Trump won’t be reinstated and 13% who said he will be. ,All in all, 19% of the people surveyed for the poll said it was either “somewhat likely” or “very likely” Trump will be reinstated as president this year. ,The conspiracy theory Trump will be reinstated as president, which has become popular among ,QAnon believers,, stems from the false claims still being pushed by some Republicans that the 2020 election was rigged. Trump has ,reportedly, become fixated with the ongoing GOP-commissioned election audit in Arizona and is pushing for similar ballot reviews across the country, telling allies (though daughter-in-law Lara Trump has since ,denied, this) the success of the recounts could result in his return to the White House this year. Of course, election officials across the country have maintained that last year’s presidential election was one of the safest in history and have denied the possibility it was marred by widespread fraud. ,As ,Forbes, has previously ,reported,, some of Trump’s more outlandish supporters and allies have advocated for antidemocratic maneuvers to seize control of the White House. Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn ,called, for a Myanmar-style military coup at a QAnon conference late last month (he has since walked back the comments). ,“Lara Trump Dismisses Reports Trump Believes He Will Be Reinstated In August” ,(Forbes) ,“Maggie Haberman: Trump Telling People He Expects To Be ‘Reinstated’ As President By August”, (Forbes) ,“Trump Says GOP Will Retake Congress, White House ‘Sooner Than You Think’ In Fundraising Video”, (Forbes)"
"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."
New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."
Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination.

The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."
NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."
Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."
"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world.

Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."
"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."
Michigan Governor Whitmer's Pipeline Move Declares War On Aviation,"Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer introduces Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden to speak ,...

 , 
  ,ENB, 
 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."
"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."
Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."

(Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images),BTS control the Billboard Global 200 chart once again this week, as their new single “Butter” doesn’t move an inch. The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."
New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."

"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."

(Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."
NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,...

Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."
Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination.

Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."
"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."

Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,... [+], (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."
"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."
Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,... [+], (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."

(Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images),BTS control the Billboard Global 200 chart once again this week, as their new single “Butter” doesn’t move an inch. The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."
New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."

  ,ENB, 
 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."
"Record Number Of Americans Say Abortion ‘Morally Acceptable,’ Gallup Poll Finds","As the Supreme Court weighs dismantling ,Roe v.

"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."
Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."
Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Record For The Largest Sales Week Of 2021 With An Old Release,"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift attends the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los ,... [+], Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."
"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world.

NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."
New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."
Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."
"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."
Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Record For The Largest Sales Week Of 2021 With An Old Release,"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift attends the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los ,... [+], Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."
"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."
NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."

"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."

"A Stronger Economic Recovery Is Within Reach, But Public Policy Is Holding It Back","Happy female shoppers tasting chocolate truffles in a candy shop. Y,In some ways the U.S. economy has already recovered from the pandemic. Real GDP is nearly back to where it was in the fourth quarter of 2019 and should surpass that mark when the next reading comes out in a few months. Consumers are also spending money, with personal consumption expenditures, actually higher, now than pre-pandemic. The labor market, however, continues to struggle, and the policies being pushed by Democrats will make things worse.,The rosy GDP and personal consumption spending numbers do not tell us much about the economy’s fundamentals since they are being juiced by trillions of dollars in government spending financed with borrowed money. Businesses need workers and capital to produce stuff—we cannot print money or borrow our way to prosperity forever. Policies that discourage people from working and investing erode the productive capacity of our economy and will make us all poorer in the long run. ,One such harmful policy is the federal unemployment insurance bonus. The ,initial policy,, enacted in March of 2020, provided a $600 weekly unemployment insurance (UI) bonus on top of the usual state-provided amount. The most recent version provides a ,$300 per week, bonus and is in effect until September, though ,some states, are opting out early. ,Providing extra income to people who could not work due to the pandemic and related government policies made some sense, but now ,cases are falling,, vaccinations are rising, and the economy needs workers. There are currently over ,eight million job openings,, but the UI bonus discourages people from taking one. A recent ,analysis, from Stephen Slivinski and Paul Bernert at Arizona State University shows that the maximum amount of weekly unemployment benefits currently exceeds the average weekly income in many cities, including Cleveland, Minneapolis, Providence, and San Antonio. It should not be surprising that some people choose to collect unemployment rather than work when the former pays more.,The lack of workers shows up in the data. The last two jobs reports ,were weak,, and there are seven million ,fewer employees, now than in February 2020. The ,prime-age labor force, participation rate (ages 25 to 54) is also down to 81% from 83%. There are a lot of available workers and a lot of available jobs, and the recovery will not be complete until millions more people are working again.,While the UI bonus is damaging the labor market now, other policy proposals from President Biden will damage it in the future if enacted. Biden wants to raise the corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, which research shows ,will discourage investment, and lower wages. Thousands of ,businesses closed, during the pandemic, and millions more are ,trying to regain, their footing after a year of capacity constraints. Higher taxes will only hinder their efforts.,Higher corporate taxes also hurt consumers via higher prices. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), passed in 2017, lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to the current 21%. One result was that many utility companies ,passed their tax savings, to consumers. Arizona Public Service, Atlanta Gas Light Co., Black Hills Energy, and Duke Energy Florida are just a few of the dozens of utility companies that lowered prices or provided customer rebates totaling millions of dollars in response to the corporate tax cut. As Jim Seward of Black Hills Energy ,said back in 2019,, “As intended, we’re proud to pass along every bit of savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to our customers. We appreciate the WPSC working with us to get the benefits of corporate tax cuts into the hands of customers via their energy bills as quickly as possible.”,If the corporate tax rate is increased, consumers can expect utility payments ,to increase, along with it.,There is also evidence that corporate taxes affect consumer prices more broadly. In ,a 2020 study,, researchers found that consumers bear approximately 31% of the corporate tax burden in the form of higher prices. They also found that the price increases were larger for lower-price items and products purchased by lower-income households. ,Many prices are already rising, including those of consumer staples such as ,gasoline,, ,housing,, and ,groceries,. It is imprudent to raise prices further by increasing corporate taxes when people’s budgets are already stretched.,A silver lining of the pandemic is that we learned new things—how to work productively from home, how to speed up the approval process for new vaccines, and how to use technology in new ways. We also eliminated some unnecessary ,regulations,, including telehealth restrictions and certificate-of-need laws. If we can stay out of our own way, a stronger economic recovery is within reach."
"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."
Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."
The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes.

"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination.

"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
"A Stronger Economic Recovery Is Within Reach, But Public Policy Is Holding It Back","Happy female shoppers tasting chocolate truffles in a candy shop. Y,In some ways the U.S. economy has already recovered from the pandemic. Real GDP is nearly back to where it was in the fourth quarter of 2019 and should surpass that mark when the next reading comes out in a few months. Consumers are also spending money, with personal consumption expenditures, actually higher, now than pre-pandemic. The labor market, however, continues to struggle, and the policies being pushed by Democrats will make things worse.,The rosy GDP and personal consumption spending numbers do not tell us much about the economy’s fundamentals since they are being juiced by trillions of dollars in government spending financed with borrowed money. Businesses need workers and capital to produce stuff—we cannot print money or borrow our way to prosperity forever. Policies that discourage people from working and investing erode the productive capacity of our economy and will make us all poorer in the long run. ,One such harmful policy is the federal unemployment insurance bonus. The ,initial policy,, enacted in March of 2020, provided a $600 weekly unemployment insurance (UI) bonus on top of the usual state-provided amount. The most recent version provides a ,$300 per week, bonus and is in effect until September, though ,some states, are opting out early. ,Providing extra income to people who could not work due to the pandemic and related government policies made some sense, but now ,cases are falling,, vaccinations are rising, and the economy needs workers. There are currently over ,eight million job openings,, but the UI bonus discourages people from taking one. A recent ,analysis, from Stephen Slivinski and Paul Bernert at Arizona State University shows that the maximum amount of weekly unemployment benefits currently exceeds the average weekly income in many cities, including Cleveland, Minneapolis, Providence, and San Antonio. It should not be surprising that some people choose to collect unemployment rather than work when the former pays more.,The lack of workers shows up in the data. The last two jobs reports ,were weak,, and there are seven million ,fewer employees, now than in February 2020. The ,prime-age labor force, participation rate (ages 25 to 54) is also down to 81% from 83%. There are a lot of available workers and a lot of available jobs, and the recovery will not be complete until millions more people are working again.,While the UI bonus is damaging the labor market now, other policy proposals from President Biden will damage it in the future if enacted. Biden wants to raise the corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, which research shows ,will discourage investment, and lower wages. Thousands of ,businesses closed, during the pandemic, and millions more are ,trying to regain, their footing after a year of capacity constraints. Higher taxes will only hinder their efforts.,Higher corporate taxes also hurt consumers via higher prices. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), passed in 2017, lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to the current 21%. One result was that many utility companies ,passed their tax savings, to consumers. Arizona Public Service, Atlanta Gas Light Co., Black Hills Energy, and Duke Energy Florida are just a few of the dozens of utility companies that lowered prices or provided customer rebates totaling millions of dollars in response to the corporate tax cut. As Jim Seward of Black Hills Energy ,said back in 2019,, “As intended, we’re proud to pass along every bit of savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to our customers. We appreciate the WPSC working with us to get the benefits of corporate tax cuts into the hands of customers via their energy bills as quickly as possible.”,If the corporate tax rate is increased, consumers can expect utility payments ,to increase, along with it.,There is also evidence that corporate taxes affect consumer prices more broadly. In ,a 2020 study,, researchers found that consumers bear approximately 31% of the corporate tax burden in the form of higher prices. They also found that the price increases were larger for lower-price items and products purchased by lower-income households. ,Many prices are already rising, including those of consumer staples such as ,gasoline,, ,housing,, and ,groceries,. It is imprudent to raise prices further by increasing corporate taxes when people’s budgets are already stretched.,A silver lining of the pandemic is that we learned new things—how to work productively from home, how to speed up the approval process for new vaccines, and how to use technology in new ways. We also eliminated some unnecessary ,regulations,, including telehealth restrictions and certificate-of-need laws. If we can stay out of our own way, a stronger economic recovery is within reach."
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."
New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."
"A Stronger Economic Recovery Is Within Reach, But Public Policy Is Holding It Back","Happy female shoppers tasting chocolate truffles in a candy shop. Y,In some ways the U.S. economy has already recovered from the pandemic. Real GDP is nearly back to where it was in the fourth quarter of 2019 and should surpass that mark when the next reading comes out in a few months. Consumers are also spending money, with personal consumption expenditures, actually higher, now than pre-pandemic. The labor market, however, continues to struggle, and the policies being pushed by Democrats will make things worse.,The rosy GDP and personal consumption spending numbers do not tell us much about the economy’s fundamentals since they are being juiced by trillions of dollars in government spending financed with borrowed money. Businesses need workers and capital to produce stuff—we cannot print money or borrow our way to prosperity forever. Policies that discourage people from working and investing erode the productive capacity of our economy and will make us all poorer in the long run. ,One such harmful policy is the federal unemployment insurance bonus. The ,initial policy,, enacted in March of 2020, provided a $600 weekly unemployment insurance (UI) bonus on top of the usual state-provided amount. The most recent version provides a ,$300 per week, bonus and is in effect until September, though ,some states, are opting out early. ,Providing extra income to people who could not work due to the pandemic and related government policies made some sense, but now ,cases are falling,, vaccinations are rising, and the economy needs workers. There are currently over ,eight million job openings,, but the UI bonus discourages people from taking one. A recent ,analysis, from Stephen Slivinski and Paul Bernert at Arizona State University shows that the maximum amount of weekly unemployment benefits currently exceeds the average weekly income in many cities, including Cleveland, Minneapolis, Providence, and San Antonio. It should not be surprising that some people choose to collect unemployment rather than work when the former pays more.,The lack of workers shows up in the data. The last two jobs reports ,were weak,, and there are seven million ,fewer employees, now than in February 2020. The ,prime-age labor force, participation rate (ages 25 to 54) is also down to 81% from 83%. There are a lot of available workers and a lot of available jobs, and the recovery will not be complete until millions more people are working again.,While the UI bonus is damaging the labor market now, other policy proposals from President Biden will damage it in the future if enacted. Biden wants to raise the corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, which research shows ,will discourage investment, and lower wages. Thousands of ,businesses closed, during the pandemic, and millions more are ,trying to regain, their footing after a year of capacity constraints. Higher taxes will only hinder their efforts.,Higher corporate taxes also hurt consumers via higher prices. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), passed in 2017, lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to the current 21%. One result was that many utility companies ,passed their tax savings, to consumers. Arizona Public Service, Atlanta Gas Light Co., Black Hills Energy, and Duke Energy Florida are just a few of the dozens of utility companies that lowered prices or provided customer rebates totaling millions of dollars in response to the corporate tax cut. As Jim Seward of Black Hills Energy ,said back in 2019,, “As intended, we’re proud to pass along every bit of savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to our customers. We appreciate the WPSC working with us to get the benefits of corporate tax cuts into the hands of customers via their energy bills as quickly as possible.”,If the corporate tax rate is increased, consumers can expect utility payments ,to increase, along with it.,There is also evidence that corporate taxes affect consumer prices more broadly. In ,a 2020 study,, researchers found that consumers bear approximately 31% of the corporate tax burden in the form of higher prices. They also found that the price increases were larger for lower-price items and products purchased by lower-income households. ,Many prices are already rising, including those of consumer staples such as ,gasoline,, ,housing,, and ,groceries,. It is imprudent to raise prices further by increasing corporate taxes when people’s budgets are already stretched.,A silver lining of the pandemic is that we learned new things—how to work productively from home, how to speed up the approval process for new vaccines, and how to use technology in new ways. We also eliminated some unnecessary ,regulations,, including telehealth restrictions and certificate-of-need laws. If we can stay out of our own way, a stronger economic recovery is within reach."
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world.

BTS Now Claim The Three Largest Streaming Weeks In The History Of Billboard’s Global Chart,"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - FEBRUARY 21: (L-R) J-Hope, SUGA, Jungkook, Jimin, RM, V, and Jin of the K-pop ,... [+], boy band BTS visit the ""Today"" Show at Rockefeller Plaza on February 21, 2020 in New York City. (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images),BTS control the Billboard Global 200 chart once again this week, as their new single “Butter” doesn’t move an inch. The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."

Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,... [+], (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
"A Stronger Economic Recovery Is Within Reach, But Public Policy Is Holding It Back","Happy female shoppers tasting chocolate truffles in a candy shop. Y,In some ways the U.S. economy has already recovered from the pandemic. Real GDP is nearly back to where it was in the fourth quarter of 2019 and should surpass that mark when the next reading comes out in a few months. Consumers are also spending money, with personal consumption expenditures, actually higher, now than pre-pandemic. The labor market, however, continues to struggle, and the policies being pushed by Democrats will make things worse.,The rosy GDP and personal consumption spending numbers do not tell us much about the economy’s fundamentals since they are being juiced by trillions of dollars in government spending financed with borrowed money. Businesses need workers and capital to produce stuff—we cannot print money or borrow our way to prosperity forever. Policies that discourage people from working and investing erode the productive capacity of our economy and will make us all poorer in the long run. ,One such harmful policy is the federal unemployment insurance bonus. The ,initial policy,, enacted in March of 2020, provided a $600 weekly unemployment insurance (UI) bonus on top of the usual state-provided amount. The most recent version provides a ,$300 per week, bonus and is in effect until September, though ,some states, are opting out early. ,Providing extra income to people who could not work due to the pandemic and related government policies made some sense, but now ,cases are falling,, vaccinations are rising, and the economy needs workers. There are currently over ,eight million job openings,, but the UI bonus discourages people from taking one. A recent ,analysis, from Stephen Slivinski and Paul Bernert at Arizona State University shows that the maximum amount of weekly unemployment benefits currently exceeds the average weekly income in many cities, including Cleveland, Minneapolis, Providence, and San Antonio. It should not be surprising that some people choose to collect unemployment rather than work when the former pays more.,The lack of workers shows up in the data. The last two jobs reports ,were weak,, and there are seven million ,fewer employees, now than in February 2020. The ,prime-age labor force, participation rate (ages 25 to 54) is also down to 81% from 83%. There are a lot of available workers and a lot of available jobs, and the recovery will not be complete until millions more people are working again.,While the UI bonus is damaging the labor market now, other policy proposals from President Biden will damage it in the future if enacted. Biden wants to raise the corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, which research shows ,will discourage investment, and lower wages. Thousands of ,businesses closed, during the pandemic, and millions more are ,trying to regain, their footing after a year of capacity constraints. Higher taxes will only hinder their efforts.,Higher corporate taxes also hurt consumers via higher prices. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), passed in 2017, lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to the current 21%. One result was that many utility companies ,passed their tax savings, to consumers. Arizona Public Service, Atlanta Gas Light Co., Black Hills Energy, and Duke Energy Florida are just a few of the dozens of utility companies that lowered prices or provided customer rebates totaling millions of dollars in response to the corporate tax cut. As Jim Seward of Black Hills Energy ,said back in 2019,, “As intended, we’re proud to pass along every bit of savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to our customers. We appreciate the WPSC working with us to get the benefits of corporate tax cuts into the hands of customers via their energy bills as quickly as possible.”,If the corporate tax rate is increased, consumers can expect utility payments ,to increase, along with it.,There is also evidence that corporate taxes affect consumer prices more broadly. In ,a 2020 study,, researchers found that consumers bear approximately 31% of the corporate tax burden in the form of higher prices. They also found that the price increases were larger for lower-price items and products purchased by lower-income households. ,Many prices are already rising, including those of consumer staples such as ,gasoline,, ,housing,, and ,groceries,. It is imprudent to raise prices further by increasing corporate taxes when people’s budgets are already stretched.,A silver lining of the pandemic is that we learned new things—how to work productively from home, how to speed up the approval process for new vaccines, and how to use technology in new ways. We also eliminated some unnecessary ,regulations,, including telehealth restrictions and certificate-of-need laws. If we can stay out of our own way, a stronger economic recovery is within reach."
Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."
"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."
The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present.

Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."

[+], boy band BTS visit the ""Today"" Show at Rockefeller Plaza on February 21, 2020 in New York City. (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images),BTS control the Billboard Global 200 chart once again this week, as their new single “Butter” doesn’t move an inch. The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world.

  ,ENB, 
 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."

He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,... [+], (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."
New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."
Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."
"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."
Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Record For The Largest Sales Week Of 2021 With An Old Release,"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift attends the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los ,... [+], Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."

"3 In 10 Republicans Believe Wacky Conspiracy Theory Trump Will Be ‘Reinstated’ As President This Year, Poll Shows","While most Americans dismiss the possibility, a significant chunk of Republicans believe the conspiracy theory buoyed by some of Donald Trump’s allies (and, reportedly, believed by the former president himself) that he’ll be back in the White House by the end of the year, a poll published Wednesday suggests. ,Former U.S. President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower in Manhattan on May 18, 2021 in New York City. ,... [+], ,The ,Politico,/Morning Consult ,survey, of 1,990 registered voters found respondents were broadly dismissive of the notion Trump could be “reinstated” as president. ,A decisive majority (72%) across the political spectrum deemed it “not very likely” or “not likely at all” Trump will have his old job by the end of the year. ,However, self-identified Republicans were less quick to dismiss the conspiracy theory. ,While 61% of GOP respondents labeled Trump’s return unlikely, some 29% said they believe he will be made president again. ,This compares to 84% of the Democrats surveyed who said Trump won’t be reinstated and 13% who said he will be. ,All in all, 19% of the people surveyed for the poll said it was either “somewhat likely” or “very likely” Trump will be reinstated as president this year. ,The conspiracy theory Trump will be reinstated as president, which has become popular among ,QAnon believers,, stems from the false claims still being pushed by some Republicans that the 2020 election was rigged. Trump has ,reportedly, become fixated with the ongoing GOP-commissioned election audit in Arizona and is pushing for similar ballot reviews across the country, telling allies (though daughter-in-law Lara Trump has since ,denied, this) the success of the recounts could result in his return to the White House this year. Of course, election officials across the country have maintained that last year’s presidential election was one of the safest in history and have denied the possibility it was marred by widespread fraud. ,As ,Forbes, has previously ,reported,, some of Trump’s more outlandish supporters and allies have advocated for antidemocratic maneuvers to seize control of the White House. Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn ,called, for a Myanmar-style military coup at a QAnon conference late last month (he has since walked back the comments). ,“Lara Trump Dismisses Reports Trump Believes He Will Be Reinstated In August” ,(Forbes) ,“Maggie Haberman: Trump Telling People He Expects To Be ‘Reinstated’ As President By August”, (Forbes) ,“Trump Says GOP Will Retake Congress, White House ‘Sooner Than You Think’ In Fundraising Video”, (Forbes)"
Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."
"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan.

Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."
Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."
The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."
"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination.

‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."
"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."

The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world.

Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,...

Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."

  ,ENB, 
 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."

Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."
Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."
Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Record For The Largest Sales Week Of 2021 With An Old Release,"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift attends the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los ,... [+], Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."
"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."
"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination.

Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
"3 In 10 Republicans Believe Wacky Conspiracy Theory Trump Will Be ‘Reinstated’ As President This Year, Poll Shows","While most Americans dismiss the possibility, a significant chunk of Republicans believe the conspiracy theory buoyed by some of Donald Trump’s allies (and, reportedly, believed by the former president himself) that he’ll be back in the White House by the end of the year, a poll published Wednesday suggests. ,Former U.S. President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower in Manhattan on May 18, 2021 in New York City. ,... [+], ,The ,Politico,/Morning Consult ,survey, of 1,990 registered voters found respondents were broadly dismissive of the notion Trump could be “reinstated” as president. ,A decisive majority (72%) across the political spectrum deemed it “not very likely” or “not likely at all” Trump will have his old job by the end of the year. ,However, self-identified Republicans were less quick to dismiss the conspiracy theory. ,While 61% of GOP respondents labeled Trump’s return unlikely, some 29% said they believe he will be made president again. ,This compares to 84% of the Democrats surveyed who said Trump won’t be reinstated and 13% who said he will be. ,All in all, 19% of the people surveyed for the poll said it was either “somewhat likely” or “very likely” Trump will be reinstated as president this year. ,The conspiracy theory Trump will be reinstated as president, which has become popular among ,QAnon believers,, stems from the false claims still being pushed by some Republicans that the 2020 election was rigged. Trump has ,reportedly, become fixated with the ongoing GOP-commissioned election audit in Arizona and is pushing for similar ballot reviews across the country, telling allies (though daughter-in-law Lara Trump has since ,denied, this) the success of the recounts could result in his return to the White House this year. Of course, election officials across the country have maintained that last year’s presidential election was one of the safest in history and have denied the possibility it was marred by widespread fraud. ,As ,Forbes, has previously ,reported,, some of Trump’s more outlandish supporters and allies have advocated for antidemocratic maneuvers to seize control of the White House. Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn ,called, for a Myanmar-style military coup at a QAnon conference late last month (he has since walked back the comments). ,“Lara Trump Dismisses Reports Trump Believes He Will Be Reinstated In August” ,(Forbes) ,“Maggie Haberman: Trump Telling People He Expects To Be ‘Reinstated’ As President By August”, (Forbes) ,“Trump Says GOP Will Retake Congress, White House ‘Sooner Than You Think’ In Fundraising Video”, (Forbes)"
Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."
"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."
Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."
Michigan Governor Whitmer's Pipeline Move Declares War On Aviation,"Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer introduces Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden to speak ,...

 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."

Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,... [+], (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."

[+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."
"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."
Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world.

"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

"A Stronger Economic Recovery Is Within Reach, But Public Policy Is Holding It Back","Happy female shoppers tasting chocolate truffles in a candy shop. Y,In some ways the U.S. economy has already recovered from the pandemic. Real GDP is nearly back to where it was in the fourth quarter of 2019 and should surpass that mark when the next reading comes out in a few months. Consumers are also spending money, with personal consumption expenditures, actually higher, now than pre-pandemic. The labor market, however, continues to struggle, and the policies being pushed by Democrats will make things worse.,The rosy GDP and personal consumption spending numbers do not tell us much about the economy’s fundamentals since they are being juiced by trillions of dollars in government spending financed with borrowed money. Businesses need workers and capital to produce stuff—we cannot print money or borrow our way to prosperity forever. Policies that discourage people from working and investing erode the productive capacity of our economy and will make us all poorer in the long run. ,One such harmful policy is the federal unemployment insurance bonus. The ,initial policy,, enacted in March of 2020, provided a $600 weekly unemployment insurance (UI) bonus on top of the usual state-provided amount. The most recent version provides a ,$300 per week, bonus and is in effect until September, though ,some states, are opting out early. ,Providing extra income to people who could not work due to the pandemic and related government policies made some sense, but now ,cases are falling,, vaccinations are rising, and the economy needs workers. There are currently over ,eight million job openings,, but the UI bonus discourages people from taking one. A recent ,analysis, from Stephen Slivinski and Paul Bernert at Arizona State University shows that the maximum amount of weekly unemployment benefits currently exceeds the average weekly income in many cities, including Cleveland, Minneapolis, Providence, and San Antonio. It should not be surprising that some people choose to collect unemployment rather than work when the former pays more.,The lack of workers shows up in the data. The last two jobs reports ,were weak,, and there are seven million ,fewer employees, now than in February 2020. The ,prime-age labor force, participation rate (ages 25 to 54) is also down to 81% from 83%. There are a lot of available workers and a lot of available jobs, and the recovery will not be complete until millions more people are working again.,While the UI bonus is damaging the labor market now, other policy proposals from President Biden will damage it in the future if enacted. Biden wants to raise the corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, which research shows ,will discourage investment, and lower wages. Thousands of ,businesses closed, during the pandemic, and millions more are ,trying to regain, their footing after a year of capacity constraints. Higher taxes will only hinder their efforts.,Higher corporate taxes also hurt consumers via higher prices. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), passed in 2017, lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to the current 21%. One result was that many utility companies ,passed their tax savings, to consumers. Arizona Public Service, Atlanta Gas Light Co., Black Hills Energy, and Duke Energy Florida are just a few of the dozens of utility companies that lowered prices or provided customer rebates totaling millions of dollars in response to the corporate tax cut. As Jim Seward of Black Hills Energy ,said back in 2019,, “As intended, we’re proud to pass along every bit of savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to our customers. We appreciate the WPSC working with us to get the benefits of corporate tax cuts into the hands of customers via their energy bills as quickly as possible.”,If the corporate tax rate is increased, consumers can expect utility payments ,to increase, along with it.,There is also evidence that corporate taxes affect consumer prices more broadly. In ,a 2020 study,, researchers found that consumers bear approximately 31% of the corporate tax burden in the form of higher prices. They also found that the price increases were larger for lower-price items and products purchased by lower-income households. ,Many prices are already rising, including those of consumer staples such as ,gasoline,, ,housing,, and ,groceries,. It is imprudent to raise prices further by increasing corporate taxes when people’s budgets are already stretched.,A silver lining of the pandemic is that we learned new things—how to work productively from home, how to speed up the approval process for new vaccines, and how to use technology in new ways. We also eliminated some unnecessary ,regulations,, including telehealth restrictions and certificate-of-need laws. If we can stay out of our own way, a stronger economic recovery is within reach."
"3 In 10 Republicans Believe Wacky Conspiracy Theory Trump Will Be ‘Reinstated’ As President This Year, Poll Shows","While most Americans dismiss the possibility, a significant chunk of Republicans believe the conspiracy theory buoyed by some of Donald Trump’s allies (and, reportedly, believed by the former president himself) that he’ll be back in the White House by the end of the year, a poll published Wednesday suggests. ,Former U.S. President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower in Manhattan on May 18, 2021 in New York City. ,... [+], ,The ,Politico,/Morning Consult ,survey, of 1,990 registered voters found respondents were broadly dismissive of the notion Trump could be “reinstated” as president. ,A decisive majority (72%) across the political spectrum deemed it “not very likely” or “not likely at all” Trump will have his old job by the end of the year. ,However, self-identified Republicans were less quick to dismiss the conspiracy theory. ,While 61% of GOP respondents labeled Trump’s return unlikely, some 29% said they believe he will be made president again. ,This compares to 84% of the Democrats surveyed who said Trump won’t be reinstated and 13% who said he will be. ,All in all, 19% of the people surveyed for the poll said it was either “somewhat likely” or “very likely” Trump will be reinstated as president this year. ,The conspiracy theory Trump will be reinstated as president, which has become popular among ,QAnon believers,, stems from the false claims still being pushed by some Republicans that the 2020 election was rigged. Trump has ,reportedly, become fixated with the ongoing GOP-commissioned election audit in Arizona and is pushing for similar ballot reviews across the country, telling allies (though daughter-in-law Lara Trump has since ,denied, this) the success of the recounts could result in his return to the White House this year. Of course, election officials across the country have maintained that last year’s presidential election was one of the safest in history and have denied the possibility it was marred by widespread fraud. ,As ,Forbes, has previously ,reported,, some of Trump’s more outlandish supporters and allies have advocated for antidemocratic maneuvers to seize control of the White House. Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn ,called, for a Myanmar-style military coup at a QAnon conference late last month (he has since walked back the comments). ,“Lara Trump Dismisses Reports Trump Believes He Will Be Reinstated In August” ,(Forbes) ,“Maggie Haberman: Trump Telling People He Expects To Be ‘Reinstated’ As President By August”, (Forbes) ,“Trump Says GOP Will Retake Congress, White House ‘Sooner Than You Think’ In Fundraising Video”, (Forbes)"
Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Record For The Largest Sales Week Of 2021 With An Old Release,"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift attends the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los ,... [+], Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."
"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination. The U.S. currently does not issue a national Covid-19 vaccination certificate and is unlikely to do so in the future.,The EU Digital Covid Certificate: Who will be issuing them and what are they for?, (El Pais),EU Digital Covid Certificate: Everything you need to know, (CNN),EU Wants To Open Up Travel For Vaccinated Tourists, (Forbes),Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus"
The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."
Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."

The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."
NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."

Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."
Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,... [+], (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world. As the division within the SEC highlights, trade offs are often framed as being between encouraging innovation and investment or implementing stringent regulatory safeguards.

"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."
New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."

Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."
Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."
NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."
Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Record For The Largest Sales Week Of 2021 With An Old Release,"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift attends the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los ,... [+], Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."
"3 In 10 Republicans Believe Wacky Conspiracy Theory Trump Will Be ‘Reinstated’ As President This Year, Poll Shows","While most Americans dismiss the possibility, a significant chunk of Republicans believe the conspiracy theory buoyed by some of Donald Trump’s allies (and, reportedly, believed by the former president himself) that he’ll be back in the White House by the end of the year, a poll published Wednesday suggests. ,Former U.S. President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower in Manhattan on May 18, 2021 in New York City. ,... [+], ,The ,Politico,/Morning Consult ,survey, of 1,990 registered voters found respondents were broadly dismissive of the notion Trump could be “reinstated” as president. ,A decisive majority (72%) across the political spectrum deemed it “not very likely” or “not likely at all” Trump will have his old job by the end of the year. ,However, self-identified Republicans were less quick to dismiss the conspiracy theory. ,While 61% of GOP respondents labeled Trump’s return unlikely, some 29% said they believe he will be made president again. ,This compares to 84% of the Democrats surveyed who said Trump won’t be reinstated and 13% who said he will be. ,All in all, 19% of the people surveyed for the poll said it was either “somewhat likely” or “very likely” Trump will be reinstated as president this year. ,The conspiracy theory Trump will be reinstated as president, which has become popular among ,QAnon believers,, stems from the false claims still being pushed by some Republicans that the 2020 election was rigged. Trump has ,reportedly, become fixated with the ongoing GOP-commissioned election audit in Arizona and is pushing for similar ballot reviews across the country, telling allies (though daughter-in-law Lara Trump has since ,denied, this) the success of the recounts could result in his return to the White House this year. Of course, election officials across the country have maintained that last year’s presidential election was one of the safest in history and have denied the possibility it was marred by widespread fraud. ,As ,Forbes, has previously ,reported,, some of Trump’s more outlandish supporters and allies have advocated for antidemocratic maneuvers to seize control of the White House. Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn ,called, for a Myanmar-style military coup at a QAnon conference late last month (he has since walked back the comments). ,“Lara Trump Dismisses Reports Trump Believes He Will Be Reinstated In August” ,(Forbes) ,“Maggie Haberman: Trump Telling People He Expects To Be ‘Reinstated’ As President By August”, (Forbes) ,“Trump Says GOP Will Retake Congress, White House ‘Sooner Than You Think’ In Fundraising Video”, (Forbes)"
"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."
"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
Michigan Governor Whitmer's Pipeline Move Declares War On Aviation,"Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer introduces Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden to speak ,...

  ,ENB, 
 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."
The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."
"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination.

‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."
Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."
"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
"A Stronger Economic Recovery Is Within Reach, But Public Policy Is Holding It Back","Happy female shoppers tasting chocolate truffles in a candy shop. Y,In some ways the U.S. economy has already recovered from the pandemic. Real GDP is nearly back to where it was in the fourth quarter of 2019 and should surpass that mark when the next reading comes out in a few months. Consumers are also spending money, with personal consumption expenditures, actually higher, now than pre-pandemic. The labor market, however, continues to struggle, and the policies being pushed by Democrats will make things worse.,The rosy GDP and personal consumption spending numbers do not tell us much about the economy’s fundamentals since they are being juiced by trillions of dollars in government spending financed with borrowed money. Businesses need workers and capital to produce stuff—we cannot print money or borrow our way to prosperity forever. Policies that discourage people from working and investing erode the productive capacity of our economy and will make us all poorer in the long run. ,One such harmful policy is the federal unemployment insurance bonus. The ,initial policy,, enacted in March of 2020, provided a $600 weekly unemployment insurance (UI) bonus on top of the usual state-provided amount. The most recent version provides a ,$300 per week, bonus and is in effect until September, though ,some states, are opting out early. ,Providing extra income to people who could not work due to the pandemic and related government policies made some sense, but now ,cases are falling,, vaccinations are rising, and the economy needs workers. There are currently over ,eight million job openings,, but the UI bonus discourages people from taking one. A recent ,analysis, from Stephen Slivinski and Paul Bernert at Arizona State University shows that the maximum amount of weekly unemployment benefits currently exceeds the average weekly income in many cities, including Cleveland, Minneapolis, Providence, and San Antonio. It should not be surprising that some people choose to collect unemployment rather than work when the former pays more.,The lack of workers shows up in the data. The last two jobs reports ,were weak,, and there are seven million ,fewer employees, now than in February 2020. The ,prime-age labor force, participation rate (ages 25 to 54) is also down to 81% from 83%. There are a lot of available workers and a lot of available jobs, and the recovery will not be complete until millions more people are working again.,While the UI bonus is damaging the labor market now, other policy proposals from President Biden will damage it in the future if enacted. Biden wants to raise the corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, which research shows ,will discourage investment, and lower wages. Thousands of ,businesses closed, during the pandemic, and millions more are ,trying to regain, their footing after a year of capacity constraints. Higher taxes will only hinder their efforts.,Higher corporate taxes also hurt consumers via higher prices. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), passed in 2017, lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to the current 21%. One result was that many utility companies ,passed their tax savings, to consumers. Arizona Public Service, Atlanta Gas Light Co., Black Hills Energy, and Duke Energy Florida are just a few of the dozens of utility companies that lowered prices or provided customer rebates totaling millions of dollars in response to the corporate tax cut. As Jim Seward of Black Hills Energy ,said back in 2019,, “As intended, we’re proud to pass along every bit of savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to our customers. We appreciate the WPSC working with us to get the benefits of corporate tax cuts into the hands of customers via their energy bills as quickly as possible.”,If the corporate tax rate is increased, consumers can expect utility payments ,to increase, along with it.,There is also evidence that corporate taxes affect consumer prices more broadly. In ,a 2020 study,, researchers found that consumers bear approximately 31% of the corporate tax burden in the form of higher prices. They also found that the price increases were larger for lower-price items and products purchased by lower-income households. ,Many prices are already rising, including those of consumer staples such as ,gasoline,, ,housing,, and ,groceries,. It is imprudent to raise prices further by increasing corporate taxes when people’s budgets are already stretched.,A silver lining of the pandemic is that we learned new things—how to work productively from home, how to speed up the approval process for new vaccines, and how to use technology in new ways. We also eliminated some unnecessary ,regulations,, including telehealth restrictions and certificate-of-need laws. If we can stay out of our own way, a stronger economic recovery is within reach."
Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,... [+], (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
BTS Now Claim The Three Largest Streaming Weeks In The History Of Billboard’s Global Chart,"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - FEBRUARY 21: (L-R) J-Hope, SUGA, Jungkook, Jimin, RM, V, and Jin of the K-pop ,... [+], boy band BTS visit the ""Today"" Show at Rockefeller Plaza on February 21, 2020 in New York City. (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images),BTS control the Billboard Global 200 chart once again this week, as their new single “Butter” doesn’t move an inch. The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally.

"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world.

Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."
"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."
New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."

Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."
"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."
"3 In 10 Republicans Believe Wacky Conspiracy Theory Trump Will Be ‘Reinstated’ As President This Year, Poll Shows","While most Americans dismiss the possibility, a significant chunk of Republicans believe the conspiracy theory buoyed by some of Donald Trump’s allies (and, reportedly, believed by the former president himself) that he’ll be back in the White House by the end of the year, a poll published Wednesday suggests. ,Former U.S. President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower in Manhattan on May 18, 2021 in New York City. ,... [+], ,The ,Politico,/Morning Consult ,survey, of 1,990 registered voters found respondents were broadly dismissive of the notion Trump could be “reinstated” as president. ,A decisive majority (72%) across the political spectrum deemed it “not very likely” or “not likely at all” Trump will have his old job by the end of the year. ,However, self-identified Republicans were less quick to dismiss the conspiracy theory. ,While 61% of GOP respondents labeled Trump’s return unlikely, some 29% said they believe he will be made president again. ,This compares to 84% of the Democrats surveyed who said Trump won’t be reinstated and 13% who said he will be. ,All in all, 19% of the people surveyed for the poll said it was either “somewhat likely” or “very likely” Trump will be reinstated as president this year. ,The conspiracy theory Trump will be reinstated as president, which has become popular among ,QAnon believers,, stems from the false claims still being pushed by some Republicans that the 2020 election was rigged. Trump has ,reportedly, become fixated with the ongoing GOP-commissioned election audit in Arizona and is pushing for similar ballot reviews across the country, telling allies (though daughter-in-law Lara Trump has since ,denied, this) the success of the recounts could result in his return to the White House this year. Of course, election officials across the country have maintained that last year’s presidential election was one of the safest in history and have denied the possibility it was marred by widespread fraud. ,As ,Forbes, has previously ,reported,, some of Trump’s more outlandish supporters and allies have advocated for antidemocratic maneuvers to seize control of the White House. Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn ,called, for a Myanmar-style military coup at a QAnon conference late last month (he has since walked back the comments). ,“Lara Trump Dismisses Reports Trump Believes He Will Be Reinstated In August” ,(Forbes) ,“Maggie Haberman: Trump Telling People He Expects To Be ‘Reinstated’ As President By August”, (Forbes) ,“Trump Says GOP Will Retake Congress, White House ‘Sooner Than You Think’ In Fundraising Video”, (Forbes)"
NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."
Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Record For The Largest Sales Week Of 2021 With An Old Release,"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift attends the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los ,... [+], Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."
"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
Michigan Governor Whitmer's Pipeline Move Declares War On Aviation,"Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer introduces Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden to speak ,...

  ,ENB, 
 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."
"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination.

Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."
Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."
"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."
Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world.

Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,...

Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on a recent visit to the ,... [+], state.,The DOE’s decision to roll back the new process rule—thereby reinstating the earlier nonbinding version—is a disappointment. It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."
New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."
Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
BTS Now Claim The Three Largest Streaming Weeks In The History Of Billboard’s Global Chart,"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - FEBRUARY 21: (L-R) J-Hope, SUGA, Jungkook, Jimin, RM, V, and Jin of the K-pop ,... [+], boy band BTS visit the ""Today"" Show at Rockefeller Plaza on February 21, 2020 in New York City. (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images),BTS control the Billboard Global 200 chart once again this week, as their new single “Butter” doesn’t move an inch. The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."
"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."
Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Record For The Largest Sales Week Of 2021 With An Old Release,"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift attends the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los ,... [+], Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."

 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."
"A Stronger Economic Recovery Is Within Reach, But Public Policy Is Holding It Back","Happy female shoppers tasting chocolate truffles in a candy shop. Y,In some ways the U.S. economy has already recovered from the pandemic. Real GDP is nearly back to where it was in the fourth quarter of 2019 and should surpass that mark when the next reading comes out in a few months. Consumers are also spending money, with personal consumption expenditures, actually higher, now than pre-pandemic. The labor market, however, continues to struggle, and the policies being pushed by Democrats will make things worse.,The rosy GDP and personal consumption spending numbers do not tell us much about the economy’s fundamentals since they are being juiced by trillions of dollars in government spending financed with borrowed money. Businesses need workers and capital to produce stuff—we cannot print money or borrow our way to prosperity forever. Policies that discourage people from working and investing erode the productive capacity of our economy and will make us all poorer in the long run. ,One such harmful policy is the federal unemployment insurance bonus. The ,initial policy,, enacted in March of 2020, provided a $600 weekly unemployment insurance (UI) bonus on top of the usual state-provided amount. The most recent version provides a ,$300 per week, bonus and is in effect until September, though ,some states, are opting out early. ,Providing extra income to people who could not work due to the pandemic and related government policies made some sense, but now ,cases are falling,, vaccinations are rising, and the economy needs workers. There are currently over ,eight million job openings,, but the UI bonus discourages people from taking one. A recent ,analysis, from Stephen Slivinski and Paul Bernert at Arizona State University shows that the maximum amount of weekly unemployment benefits currently exceeds the average weekly income in many cities, including Cleveland, Minneapolis, Providence, and San Antonio. It should not be surprising that some people choose to collect unemployment rather than work when the former pays more.,The lack of workers shows up in the data. The last two jobs reports ,were weak,, and there are seven million ,fewer employees, now than in February 2020. The ,prime-age labor force, participation rate (ages 25 to 54) is also down to 81% from 83%. There are a lot of available workers and a lot of available jobs, and the recovery will not be complete until millions more people are working again.,While the UI bonus is damaging the labor market now, other policy proposals from President Biden will damage it in the future if enacted. Biden wants to raise the corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, which research shows ,will discourage investment, and lower wages. Thousands of ,businesses closed, during the pandemic, and millions more are ,trying to regain, their footing after a year of capacity constraints. Higher taxes will only hinder their efforts.,Higher corporate taxes also hurt consumers via higher prices. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), passed in 2017, lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to the current 21%. One result was that many utility companies ,passed their tax savings, to consumers. Arizona Public Service, Atlanta Gas Light Co., Black Hills Energy, and Duke Energy Florida are just a few of the dozens of utility companies that lowered prices or provided customer rebates totaling millions of dollars in response to the corporate tax cut. As Jim Seward of Black Hills Energy ,said back in 2019,, “As intended, we’re proud to pass along every bit of savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to our customers. We appreciate the WPSC working with us to get the benefits of corporate tax cuts into the hands of customers via their energy bills as quickly as possible.”,If the corporate tax rate is increased, consumers can expect utility payments ,to increase, along with it.,There is also evidence that corporate taxes affect consumer prices more broadly. In ,a 2020 study,, researchers found that consumers bear approximately 31% of the corporate tax burden in the form of higher prices. They also found that the price increases were larger for lower-price items and products purchased by lower-income households. ,Many prices are already rising, including those of consumer staples such as ,gasoline,, ,housing,, and ,groceries,. It is imprudent to raise prices further by increasing corporate taxes when people’s budgets are already stretched.,A silver lining of the pandemic is that we learned new things—how to work productively from home, how to speed up the approval process for new vaccines, and how to use technology in new ways. We also eliminated some unnecessary ,regulations,, including telehealth restrictions and certificate-of-need laws. If we can stay out of our own way, a stronger economic recovery is within reach."
"2022 Nissan Pathfinder, Better All Around, But Not A Breakaway From The Pack","2022 Nissan Frontier,When Nissan introduced the original Pathfinder 35 years ago, it was basically an SUV version of the then current Hardbody compact pickup truck. As the fifth generation Pathfinder is about to launch, the Pathfinder has evolved dramatically, dropping the body on frame architecture for the second generation and then becoming a front-wheel-drive based crossover when the last one debuted nine years ago. The 2022 edition drops this summer into an ever more competitive segment with some design cues that call back to the original. But can it compete with the best in class?,Since the last Pathfinder hit the streets in 2012, almost every competitor has been updated and newcomers have launched. Ford reverted back to a rear-drive architecture for the Explorer, Toyota debuted a new Highlander with a 34 mpg hybrid powertrain, Volkswagen added the Atlas and Hyundai and Kia brought forth the Palisade and Telluride. The latter two in particular have received generally rave reviews and are widely considered the segment leaders.,2022 Nissan Frontier,The old Pathfinder like many Nissans in recent years was viewed as inoffensive but dull. The design was soft and somewhat uninspired. The new model definitely doesn’t have that problem. It brings a lot more character to the competition. It now has a far more rugged appearance thanks to sharper creases and overall boxier shape not unlike the smaller Rogue. In fact, there is a very notable family resemblance to the compact crossover. ,However, the Pathfinder does have a few visual call backs to 1986, but they are subtle enough that most people probably won’t even notice. Between the top horizontal slat of the grille and the forward edge of the hood are three horizontal slots. Just like slots in the leading edge of the hood of the original, except you can only see them in the right lighting conditions. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The forward leaning C-pillar somewhat evokes the body work above the triangular second window of the two-door 1986 model. But people shopping in this segment probably don’t even remember that vehicle. They will however notice the newly available two-tone roof treatment that reduces the visual height. Finally and most noticeable are the blistered fenders. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Overall, the size hasn’t changed significantly. While the track width has increased by 1.2-inches, width, height and length are within 1-inch of the outgoing version. Whatever the nostalgia value, the 2022 Pathfinder is definitely more handsome than its predecessor and will likely get attention from more potential buyers. ,That attention is good, because they’ll want to check out the massively upgraded interior. The cabin looks more modern than before and features better feeling and looking materials. One of the most important upgrades is the infotainment touchscreen. I’ve often complained about the low quality displays used in prior Nissan vehicles. They were dim, low contrast and resolution and hard to see with sunglasses on. The new screen is much more pleasant to look at and easier to read. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,The S and SV trim levels have a new 8-inch display while the SL and Platinum get a 9-inch unit. The user interface hasn’t changed and while it doesn’t look particularly modern, it’s relatively usable. Both Apple Carplay and Android Auto are supported, but only iPhone users can go wireless, Android still needs to plug in. There is a wireless charging pad and USB-A and USB-C ports in each of the first two rows on all trims. Third row USB-A ports are included on the SL and Platinum.  A suite of driver assists including both front and rear automatic emergency braking and blindspot monitors are standard while ProPilot Assist with adaptive cruise control and lane centering is available on all but the base trim.,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Since these three-row utilities have become the family hauler of choice over the past decade, it’s important that they be accessible for all seating positions. The third row has three seat-belts, but if you want to use them all, the occupants shouldn’t be too broad shouldered although there is adequate head and leg room. A three-passenger bench is standard in the second row, but captain’s chairs are available. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the best features is when child car seats are installed in the second row. With a push of a button on either the side of the seat or the back (accessible by third row passengers) the whole seat tilts forward from the front mounting point without having to remove the child seat. When equipped with captain’s chairs, the console between the seats is also easily removable without tools to provide a pass-through to the back row. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,One of the challenges of three-row crossovers is that they often leave little cargo space behind the third-row. The Pathfinder has 16.6 cubic feet which can accommodate four golf bags, a 120-quart cooler or six carry-on bags. With the second and third rows folded, the interior is wide enough to accommodate a 4 ft wide sheet of plywood or drywall, although it will be hanging out the back. There’s also a hidden storage compartment under the cargo area with a friction hinge lid that will stay in place while you stash away tools or wet beach gear. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Under the hood, the Pathfinder retains the long-running VQ 3.5-liter V6 with 284-hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. But the new model ditches the continuously variable transmission in favor of a ZF 9-speed automatic transmission. The 9-speed has upgraded control software relative to other applications of this unit and shifted smoothly without excessive hunting between gears. ,The suspension retains the same basic layout with struts in the front and a multi-link setup at the back. The whole thing has been retuned and the electric power steering has been upgraded. The roll stiffness has been increased at both ends and there is a wider tire contact patch with the 225/20R20 all-season tires. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,On the road, the new Pathfinder feels significantly more composed with less side to side head toss and better feedback through the steering wheel even though the effort has been reduced. Through some curvy roads near Ann Arbor, Mich. the Pathfinder felt surprisingly responsive while retaining good ride comfort even on broken pavement. ,While the V6 isn’t going to compete with the likes of Ford’s turbocharged Ecoboost engines in straight-ahead acceleration, it still provides more than adequate performance for the intended use case. Merging onto highways was effortless and regardless of speed, it felt fairly quiet and composed. Nissan’s ProPilot assist helps to keep the vehicle centered in the lane and when using navigation, it will automatically slow the vehicle when taking tighter curves or highway interchanges based on the road geometry data in the maps. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,Towards the end of our drive we got to do some off-roading at Holly Oaks ORV park north of Detroit. The new Pathfinder offers a new 4WD system that directly couples to provide equal front and rear torque distribution. There’s also a terrain mode selection system including standard, sport, eco, snow, sand, mud/rut and towing that alters throttle response, stability control, steering effort and torque distribution. On a variety of off-road terrain that is far tougher than what 99% of Pathfinders are ever likely to see, it performed without issue. ,The only thing that would be helpful is if Nissan included an option to keep the surround cameras up to higher speeds (about 15-20 mph) while using off-road modes. The Ford Bronco Sport does this which makes it a lot easier to see over the crest of steep hills or along the side of the vehicle on narrow trails. ,2022 Nissan Frontier, first drive,If there is one weakness to the 2022 Pathfinder it’s that the fuel economy is only so-so. Combined fuel economy is 23 mpg and I saw 21 mpg during three hours of driving. Like the Rogue, Nissan doesn’t have any electrification options available. The Explorer and Highlander each have hybrids now and Hyundai and Kia are expected to add those options in the not too distant future. ,The 2022 Pathfinder should be arriving at Nissan dealers in the coming weeks. Pricing starts at $33,410 for the front-drive S trim and tops out just over $48,000 for a platinum four-wheel drive. That’s all fairly similar to the competition. So how does it match up against the competition? At 6,000 pounds it has more towing capacity, and has some clever features like the tilting second-row seats and rear automatic emergency braking. Its design is certainly more competitive against the other recent offerings, although the interior of the Palisade and Telluride are arguably more upscale than the Nissan. The Pathfinder is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor in almost every way so customers probably won’t come away disappointed."
Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."
The $5 Trillion Monster Now Tormenting Japan’s 2021,"Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, in a panel to discuss central bank communication on ,... [+], November 14, 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany. ,Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may have just pulled off history’s biggest tease.,Since 2013, Kuroda has overseen an unprecedented expansion of a central bank’s balance sheet. By late 2018, it ,topped the size, of Japan’s $5 trillion economy—and has only grown since. Though most of those purchases were bonds, the BOJ also hoarded stocks via exchange-traded funds with increasing fervor.,In 2020 alone, Kuroda’s team added $65 billion to its ETF holdings, making the BOJ Japan’s investment “whale.” That’s up from $38 billion in 2013.,Yet in May—and here comes the big tease—the BOJ went an entire month without adding to its EFT holdings, the first 30-day pause in eight years. That has many investors believing Kuroda is suddenly serious about pulling BOJ support for stocks.,Don’t bet on it, as Japan’s Covid-19 recovery lags the rest of the developed world, and perhaps significantly.,The ,yen’s 6% drop, versus the U.S. dollar tells the story as well any data set. As North America and Europe stabilize and begin producing decent growth, the forces behind Japan’s downturn remain stubbornly negative. Retail sales, industrial production, wages and business confidence have many economists convinced Japan might not return to pre-Covid levels until 2023.,China is doing so now, while laggards are generally looking at 2022 rebounds. That Japan’s revival is still two years out is influencing inflation expectations. As the U.S. and other top economies brace for rising consumer prices, Japan’s are heading back toward the red.,In April, core consumer prices fell for the ,ninth straight month,. The 0.1% year-on-year decline was remarkably out of step with trends virtually everywhere else. It helps explain why the yen is the worst-performer among Group-of-10 currencies. It explains, too, why the BOJ won’t be “tapering” anytime soon, even if the Federal Reserve does in Washington.,It follows, then, that the BOJ’s ETF holdings are here to stay—and in ways that offer lessons for peers.,By the time Kuroda arrived at BOJ headquarters, the central bank had already been toying with quantitative easing for 12 years. Fourteen, if we’re talking about when the BOJ became the first major monetary authority to slash interest rates to zero. Kuroda supersized the effort. First, he cornered the government bond market. Then, the stock market.,U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing on ""The Semiannual ,... [+], Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on February 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. ,Yet all this support from a state-run institution is warping stock market dynamics. In February, the BOJ’s paper gains on ETF holdings hit a record $149 billion the same week the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to a ,three-decade high,. That gain is more than double Myanmar’s annual gross domestic product.,The problem, of course, is that the BOJ is effectively trapped. If it tries to withdraw from the bond market, yields would almost certainly shoot higher. The only thing making Tokyo’s 250% debt-to-GDP ratio seem somewhat manageable is 10-year rates at 0.06%. Because credit is essentially ,free,, Japan supports its growth via deficit spending. ,It’s not a reach to say Tokyo had created a monetary Frankenstein, of sorts. If the BOJ isn’t careful, this monster will get out of control and come back to harm its creator.,Fed Governor Jerome Powell is in a similar predicament. He is sure to learn soon that pushing into myriad asset classes is one thing. Exiting is quite another. If Powell tries to taper, politicians, corporate CEOs, bankers and investors alike would howl in protest.,The powerful selloff sure to ensue, meantime, could undo ,post-Covid, recoveries everywhere. Any hint the Fed might be winding up liquidity would probably accelerate the yen’s downtrend.,Hedge fund bets against the yen are near the highest levels since early 2019. Part of the negativity reflects cash flowing out of Japan for mergers and acquisitions. Direct investment overseas, including M&A, jumped nearly 30% between January and March from a year ago.,Most of it, though, reflects fears that Japan’s recovery is two years out. Even good news on Japan these days tends to be bad. Case in point: the economy, it turns out, ,only shrank 3.9%, in the first quarter, better than the initial estimate of a 5.1% contraction.,“We expect the economy will experience another contraction in Q2 given the extended restrictions, which will weigh heavily especially on the services sector,” says Makoto Tsuchiya at Oxford Economics.,Deflation, meantime, is once again a much bigger risk than rising prices. All the more reason to think the BOJ’s $5 trillion balance is more likely to grow than shrink as Japan staggers through 2021. And the monsters it created along the way loom on the horizon."
"3 In 10 Republicans Believe Wacky Conspiracy Theory Trump Will Be ‘Reinstated’ As President This Year, Poll Shows","While most Americans dismiss the possibility, a significant chunk of Republicans believe the conspiracy theory buoyed by some of Donald Trump’s allies (and, reportedly, believed by the former president himself) that he’ll be back in the White House by the end of the year, a poll published Wednesday suggests. ,Former U.S. President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower in Manhattan on May 18, 2021 in New York City. ,... [+], ,The ,Politico,/Morning Consult ,survey, of 1,990 registered voters found respondents were broadly dismissive of the notion Trump could be “reinstated” as president. ,A decisive majority (72%) across the political spectrum deemed it “not very likely” or “not likely at all” Trump will have his old job by the end of the year. ,However, self-identified Republicans were less quick to dismiss the conspiracy theory. ,While 61% of GOP respondents labeled Trump’s return unlikely, some 29% said they believe he will be made president again. ,This compares to 84% of the Democrats surveyed who said Trump won’t be reinstated and 13% who said he will be. ,All in all, 19% of the people surveyed for the poll said it was either “somewhat likely” or “very likely” Trump will be reinstated as president this year. ,The conspiracy theory Trump will be reinstated as president, which has become popular among ,QAnon believers,, stems from the false claims still being pushed by some Republicans that the 2020 election was rigged. Trump has ,reportedly, become fixated with the ongoing GOP-commissioned election audit in Arizona and is pushing for similar ballot reviews across the country, telling allies (though daughter-in-law Lara Trump has since ,denied, this) the success of the recounts could result in his return to the White House this year. Of course, election officials across the country have maintained that last year’s presidential election was one of the safest in history and have denied the possibility it was marred by widespread fraud. ,As ,Forbes, has previously ,reported,, some of Trump’s more outlandish supporters and allies have advocated for antidemocratic maneuvers to seize control of the White House. Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn ,called, for a Myanmar-style military coup at a QAnon conference late last month (he has since walked back the comments). ,“Lara Trump Dismisses Reports Trump Believes He Will Be Reinstated In August” ,(Forbes) ,“Maggie Haberman: Trump Telling People He Expects To Be ‘Reinstated’ As President By August”, (Forbes) ,“Trump Says GOP Will Retake Congress, White House ‘Sooner Than You Think’ In Fundraising Video”, (Forbes)"
Tokyo Olympics Media Coverage Needs To Balance A Sports Event And Potential Covid Superspreader,"By Arthur L. Caplan & Lee H. Igel,A general view of the five-party meeting, which IOC President Thomas Bach, IPC President Andrew ,... [+], Parsons and Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Yuriko Koike attend online while Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimot and Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa attend at the Tokyo 2020 headquarters on March 3, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Du Xiaoyi - Pool/Getty Images),With the host city and nation currently battling another wave of coronavirus cases, how much should media covering the Tokyo Olympic Games focus on the public health crisis swirling around one of the world’s iconic sports mega-events?,The Games are setting up to go on as-scheduled in Japan's capital city and other locales. Already postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee and local organizing committee is pressing on with the nearly $30-billion, two week-long festival of sport, culture, and education. This despite Tokyo being under a government-mandated state of emergency that will last until at least nearly one month before the Game’s opening ceremony. It is also despite the prevalence of high infection rates and very low vaccination rates across the nation, ,polls showing most of the population no longer wanting to host the Games,, and emergence of fast-growing and highly-contagious variant strains spreading around the world.,The IOC could always decide to postpone the Games again. But that is always easier said than done and doesn't appear likely this time around. It would probably take an unforeseen catastrophic event, rather than Covid, to get in the way of the Games taking place this year. That is because, in addition to the IOC and government officials, there is a global multitude of athletes, coaches, trainers, national delegations, sponsors, food suppliers, and broadcasters who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and innumerable hours aimed at the two weeks in Tokyo.,Most of the media attention about the Tokyo Games has so far been centering around the public health situation in Japan. Part of that has included items ranging from updates about the ,IOC's safety protocol playbooks, to ,no foreign spectators being permitted at Olympic events, to ,medical professionals pleading, from hospital wards for the Games to be called off. But as the Games grow closer to getting underway, more attention will likely start turning toward storylines about athletes and athletic competition. Sports media will be replacing medical media. That ought not happen.,Some sports-related human interest stories will be welcomed by many people. They should be, especially given the more than a year of wall-to-wall news about all things Covid. During that span of time, sports have shown to be a key form of entertainment, with athletes often classified as essential workers. But dedicating more attention to athletic performance lends to detaching entirely from the public health issues.,There is no shortage of critical health- and safety-related questions that demand attention. What are the health, economic, social, and political impacts of vaccines and quarantines on a largely unvaccinated nation? Should vaccinations be required for any and all athletes, coaches, delegates, sponsors, suppliers, and media members planning to be in Tokyo—and, if so, which vaccines should be certified as acceptable? How should privileges afforded to athletes be regarded when they are generally at low risk of death, but from nations where Covid infections rates are running out of control, such as India, Brazil, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, and Peru? Will athletes really sign the waivers to release the IOC and Japan from liability if Covid makes them sick? Will athletes really stay in the Olympic sites and how vigorously will they be monitored? And will nations relying on quarantine to manage the virus really welcome home athletes and their support staff who may have been exposed to Covid by their peers?,NBC holds the media rights for the Tokyo Games to be distributed across the United States. It is part of ,a $7.75-billion extension that was agreed to with the IOC in 2014, and which runs through the 2032 Games. Airing the athletic competitions and athlete storylines will likely draw tens-of-millions of people to viewing more than 3-billion minutes of video across the network's platforms. Most of those minutes are understandably certain to include more highlights of the international array of athletes rather than the Covid situation in nations from which they hail. Still, plenty of those minutes ought to be allotted to educating viewers on the latter.,During the dozen times that he led hosting Olympic Games broadcasts on NBC from 1988 to 2016, ,Bob Costas, insisted on bringing light to relevant social issues. Many times, they were of the variety that the IOC, host nations, and their Olympic partners preferred not be broached because they touched on politics. The Zika virus outbreak around the 2016 Rio Games is a recent example. But, to Costas, it wasn't about trying to be controversial or political—it was about aiming to be moral and responsible.,Costas took the same approach four years earlier at the 2012 London Games. The IOC was scarcely acknowledging the 40,th, anniversary of the “Munich Massacre,” in which members of the Israeli Olympic delegation were taken hostage and murdered by terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games. Acknowledging the reality wasn't lost on Costas: he used a spot during the opening ceremony to speak to it, followed by seconds of silence.,The legacy of the Munich Games also has to something to suggest to what could be that of the Tokyo Games. That is, the tragedy that took place first in the Athletes' Village and, ultimately, at a nearby airport overshadows the seven gold medals won by U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz, three golds awarded to Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut, gold won by Mary Peters in the pentathlon, U.S. versus Soviet Union men's basketball final, or any of the other achievements that took place. And if there is any enduring image and soundbite, it is of ,ABC Sports broadcaster Jim McKay providing a live television update on the final condition of the athletes-turned-hostages,: “They are all gone.” ,Since its founding in the summer of 1894, the IOC has been insistent that Olympic Games are no place for politics. Yet it has always been conscious of the role that the Olympic movement can play in moderating the impact of politics on society. It is not for nothing that part of the reason for choosing Tokyo as host of the 1964 Summer Games was to recognize Japan's reconstruction and reintroduction to the global community after its role as an Axis Power during World War Two.,All media outlets covering the upcoming Olympic Games have an obligation to balance portraying the sports side and the public health particulars. The entire world has been learning for more than a year that it is tough to hide from the coronavirus. It ought to be no less difficult to hide its existence and impacts on people and places with the whole world watching.,Wishful thinking, looking in the opposite direction, and denying reality won't make Covid stay away from the Olympics. The Games might even slow down efforts to return to the “new normal.” When international sport occurs in the midst of a still-dangerous pandemic, media coverage must fully reflect that reality."
NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."
Why Electric Vehicles Are ‘Greener’ Than Ever In All 50 States,"A just-released study found that the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline ,... [+], vehicle in all 50 states. ,One of the cautions cited by electric vehicle (EV) naysayers is that they merely shift emissions from the tailpipe to the local grid’s power source. And while there is a kernel of truth to this notion—they’re indeed more benign to the environment in states where renewable energy resources are prevalent—the average EV is cleaner to run than the average new gasoline vehicle in all 50 states. ,That’s according to a just-released study conducted the ,Union of Concerned Scientists, (UCS), which determined that global warming emissions related to EVs has fallen by 15 percent since 2018. For 97 percent of the U.S., driving an electric car is equivalent or better with regard to the environment than a gasoline-powered model that gets 50 mpg. ,In fact, the organization says the average EV currently on the market is now on a par, environmentally, with an internal combustion vehicle that’s rated at 93 mpg. The most efficient gas-driven model sold in the U.S. gets 59 mpg, with the average new petrol-powered car at 31 mpg.,For a gasoline car, the UCS considers a vehicle’s tailpipe emissions, as well as the effects of pumping crude oil from the ground, transporting it to a refinery, creating gasoline, and transporting it to filling stations. For electric vehicles, the UCS’ environmental estimates include both emissions from the power plants themselves, along with those created by the production of coal, natural gas or other fuels used to generate electricity. ,Of course the degree to which an EV ultimately affects the atmosphere still varies from one part of the country to another, depending on the local power source. In some parts of the country, driving the average new gasoline car will produce four to eight times the emissions of the average EV. The UCS says the average EV driven in upstate New York produces total emissions that would be equivalent to a gasoline car that gets an impossible 255-mpg. In even the dirtiest areas for generating electricity, EVs are responsible for as much emissions as a conventionally powered car that gets over 40 mpg.,What’s more, the average, an EV’s environmental impact can be expected to become less deleterious over time as the grid gets cleaner, while gasoline vehicles’ emissions are more or less fixed.  ,To that end the UCS says that reductions in EV-responsible emissions are dropping in lockstep with reduced use of coal and increases in natural gas, wind, and solar power as electricity sources. Electricity from coal has fallen from 45 percent to 23 percent over the last decade, while solar and wind generation has grown from less than two percent to nine percent from 2009-2019. What’s more, the average EV’s efficiency has risen by about six percent since 2018, due largely to sales of the Tesla Model 3, which accounts for more than 20 percent of all EVs (and more than one third of plug-in cars) sold in the U.S. to date.,The UCS provides regional comparisons of EV emissions compared to their gas-powered equivalents ,here,. ,While they will not be among the most efficient battery-powered rides on the road, the coming fleets of full-electric large pickup trucks and SUVs should likewise benefit to Mother Nature. As an example, the UCS says the upcoming full-electric Ford F-150 lightning is estimated to be responsible for less than half of the global warming emissions that can be attributed to the standard F-Series truck in 70 percent of the country, and less than a quarter on the cleanest grids in the U.S.,Of course, the environmental benefit is not the only reason to consider buying an electric car. Charging an EV at home is far cheaper than keeping a gas-powered vehicle’s tank filled, especially with average petrol prices at around $3.00 per gallon Plus, ,Consumer Reports ,says that ongoing maintenance and repair costs are 50 percent less costly over the life of an EV because there are fewer moving parts to fail, and there’s no need to change fluids, filters, and belts.,If you’re considering an EV, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) maintains a downloadable interactive spreadsheet file that will compute operating costs and estimate the true environmental impact of EVs for specific U.S. Zip Codes. It provides “Green Scores” based on the local source of electricity and gives the regional cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It also gives a comparison of how the chosen electric car stands up next to its closest gas-fueled equivalent. ,You can download the ACEEE’s Electric Vehicle Calculator to see how various EVs stack up where you live ,here,."
"Digital Covid Passports Approved By The European Union From July 1, In A Boost To Cross-Border Travel","The European Union’s Parliament approved the EU digital Covid Certificate in a vote on Wednesday, in a move that will allow the bloc to restart travel by allowing member nations to verify if incoming travelers are either vaccinated against or have tested negative for Covid-19.,A mockup of the EU's Covid Digital Passport that is set to go into effect on July 1.,The Parliament passed the new digital Covid Certificate Regulations by a large majority of 546-93 with 51 members abstaining, according to a ,press statement,.,The system will go into effect on July 1 and be in place for 12 months.,The digital certificate can either be carried in digital or paper format and it will certify that a person has either been vaccinated against Covid-19, has recently tested negative for the disease or has recovered from an infection.,As part of the rules, EU states have agreed to not impose any additional travel restrictions—like mandatory quarantines, additional testing or self-isolation—on travelers who hold a green certificate.,If any restrictions are put in place within a country, they will have to give 48 hours’ notice to other member states and the Commission, and the public should be given 24 hours of notice.,All EU members are required to accept vaccination certificates issued by other members for shots that have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, they may also choose to accept certificates for vaccines that have been approved by other nations or listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use. This is a key step since some EU members have approved the use of Russian and Chinese-made vaccines which are yet to be cleared by the EMA.,Chair of the EU Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, said: “Today Parliament has set the pace to restore free movement and a fully functional Schengen while we continue to fight this pandemic…EU states are encouraged to refrain from imposing further restrictions, unless strictly necessary and proportionate, and it is reassuring that some are already issuing the certificate.”,Critics of such vaccine travel passes or certificates have expressed concern over the discriminatory impact of such a system due to the unequal rollout of vaccines around the world. In January, ,WHO officials said, governments should “not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry” at present. However, EU leaders have ,previously stated, that, unlike so-called “vaccine passports,” the EU’s Digital Green Certificate also considers a negative Covid test or a previous Covid-19 infection.,EU officials ,have stated, that they will also open up the Covid passes to non-EU residents, including Americans, ,according to CNN,. Spain and France are the latest countries opening up to U.S. tourists, and both require international travelers to provide proof of full vaccination.

"Billionaire Xavier Niel’s Telecom Giant Free Hosted 48% Of Child Sex Abuse Imagery Found During Two-Year Investigation, Says Nonprofit Group","Xavier Niel, Iliad majority shareholder,Free, the French telecom giant that is majority owned by billionaire ,Xavier Niel,, is not doing enough to tackle child sexual abuse imagery on its servers, according to The Canadian Centre for Child Protection. The nonprofit group alleges that nearly half of the Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) discovered during a two-year investigation it conducted was “physically hosted” and downloaded using Free’s telecom services.,The research report, released Wednesday, looked at the availability of child sexual abuse material and the role of electronic service providers in spreading it, and found that Free was used by those “hosting and sharing” around 1.1 million images or video files of alleged CSAM or harmful-abusive content between 2018 and 2020.,In the report, titled Project Arachnid, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection says that those intent on distributing CSAM “have taken advantage of Free’s hosting service to anonymously store media online, and then disseminate the direct download link on forums across the internet.”,There is no indication at this time that Free or majority owner Xavier Niel who holds over 70% of parent group Iliad were aware of the issue. Xavier Niel and Iliad have not offered a response to the allegations, or answered ,Forbes’, questions after having been alerted to the report this morning. ,French telecom and Internet company Iliad founder, Xavier Niel,The Canadian Centre for Child Protection has taken on the battle to remove CSAM from the internet by specifically targeting the web service infrastructure onto which it is uploaded, using a web platform designed to detect known images and immediately issue removal notices to electronic service providers (ESPs). Project Arachnid does not claim to have uncovered the total universe of CSAM on the internet. The search uses 'web crawlers’ or bots, similar to small search engines, to access content located at URLs on the clear and dark web. When images are found they are compared to a database of previously verified media. If the system detects a match–a recognized CSAM image–a takedown notice is automatically sent requesting its removal. Over the past two years, the system has found more than 5.4 million CSAM images. However, it’s slow progress and the group is facing a backlog of more than 32.5 million suspect media that have yet to be assessed. ,The report points to Free, which is publicly traded through parent group Iliad on the Euronext Paris, as the “single” internet provider responsible for “a very significant volume” of child abuse imagery, and one that is not doing enough to address the wider issue. The report adds that, during its investigation, 48% of all child abuse imagery media found during the two years of its investigation (images and videos) are  both “linked” and physically hosted on Free’s file hosting service.,Specifically, the report found that by using Tor-based chat forums (a part of the so-called Dark Web) and direct downloads rather than traditional webpages, “an unknown number of anonymous users are able to view the direct download links and passwords required to unlock and access the content,” the report says. “The total known availability of CSAM and harmful-abusive images or videos accessible through Free’s hosting service triggered more than 2.7 million flags, according to the report.,Free is one of the most popular internet service providers in France, offering internet, TV and landline services to homes, plus its own mobile phone network. In its first quarter 2021 results Free reported that 3 million French homes currently subscribe to its Fiber Free broadband. In March this year Iliad Group posted consolidated revenues for 2020 up 10.1% to $7.15 billion and profits of $511 million. The group announced in its annual report that the dividend will increase to $3.66 per share.,Xavier Niel, CEO of Illiad, Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH group, and Alexandre Arnault,Xavier Niel founded the business in 1996, three years after starting France’s first internet provider, WorldNet. ,Forbes, estimates his net worth to be $8.4 billion, thanks largely to his stake in Iliad.,The results of this investigation do not come entirely out of the blue for Niel and Iliad’s leadership team who have been alerted to problematic content–although not CSAM–on their service in the past. In October 2007, Free’s file hosting service–dl.free.fr–faced criticism from France’s then-Minister of Culture for allowing “users to anonymously upload large volumes of pirated material”–namely pirated movies and music–”on dl.free.fr.” News stories in 2007 did not detail Iliad’s response and they have not added further comment today.,The issue has been discussed online in France at least once before the publication of the investigation today. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection directed ,Forbes, to a Reddit post from October 2019 on a general French interest discussion forum, which claimed that Free’s file hosting site dl.free.fr “has become the # 1 choice” in the “exchange of child pornography content online.” ,A spokesperson for The Canadian Centre for Child Protection told ,Forbes ,that Free has a “legal and moral responsibility” to ensure its services are not being misused to harm children, adding that the data shows, “the service they operate is being used to make a large volume of harmful images available on the internet.”,The European Commission introduced the interim e-Privacy regulation in September 2020 obliging online companies to actively detect and remove child sexual abuse online."
"U.K. Calls For Climate ‘Marshall Plan,’ But Will The G7 Deliver?","Calm before the storm: the picturesque town of St. Ives in Cornwall, U.K., near the site of the G7 ,... [+], summit on Friday, where world leaders will meet to discuss global crises including the pandemic and climate change.,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a green “Marshall Plan” to fight climate change ahead of the G7 meeting of wealthy nations this weekend. But it remains to be seen whether the G7, or even Johnson’s own country, will live up to expectations.,According to ,The Times, newspaper,, Johnson said the world’s largest economies should support low and middle income countries in Africa and Asia to build large scale renewable energy projects. Johnson is understood to have directed the U.K. Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury to put together ideas for achieving this, to be presented at the G7. ,The call comes amid unprecedented pressure from policy experts and international leaders for the richest countries to take on more of the responsibility for helping the world overcome the coronavirus pandemic and tackle the climate crisis. It also comes at a time when the U.K. government is pushing to ,decrease its foreign aid budget,, from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.,The G7 club of the wealthiest nations, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., will meet on Friday in the U.K. as Covid-19 continues to ravage the global south and as scientists ,warn, that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than previously thought. Last year’s summit was cancelled because of the pandemic, the only occasion since the group’s founding in 1975 that the meeting has not gone ahead. But now, the consensus appears to be that the world can no longer wait.,Among the growing chorus of voices, the United Nations has been especially vocal about what it expects from the seven countries. UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa called on the G7 to provide additional support for developing countries to strengthen climate policies. ,“We know developing nations need this commitment but G7 nations need it as well,” Espinosa said in an address to the G7 last month. “The reality is that this is an act of collective self interest. Again, we cannot put out a wildfire threatening to engulf the whole world with a few wet blankets. We must fully extinguish it.”,The Elders,, an influential group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, sent letters to the leaders of all the G7 nations demanding urgent and decisive action on both vaccines and climate change. ,“In this moment of global crisis, multilateralism is uniquely important and uniquely threatened,” the letters read. “The threat will increase if the multilateral system fails to deliver on the pressing concerns of the moment—climate change and pandemic recovery. A failure in either regard risks further reducing trust in the multilateral system and may enable autocratic and populist leaders to do further damage to multilateral institutions, undermining the world’s ability to collectively tackle its shared challenges.”,Chair of The Elders Mary Robinson, the first woman prime minister of Ireland and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, called out the U.K. for its controversial proposed cut to foreign aid.,“As [G7] host, the U.K. has a particular responsibility to match rhetoric with actions; a reversal of the planned suspension of its 0.7 percent aid target would send a clear signal and spur other G7 states to similar ambition,” Robinson said.,Nick Mabey, co-founder and CEO of European climate think tank E3G, told me what the G7 could and should be expected to do—and why climate action first necessitates Covid-19 action.,“What the G7 does is determine how much pressure there is on other countries to step up,” Mabey said. “But any pretence that you’re showing solidarity with the developing world on this long-term existential threat of climate change rings hollow if you don’t also overcome coronavirus. There’s now recognition that you can’t deal with different policies in separate silos; these are big issues that have to be dealt with together.” As a former senior government advisor and an attendee to many previous G7 meetings, Mabey said this summit was especially crucial. “I think this G7 has the highest expectations I’ve seen since the [2008] financial crisis,” he said.,Mabey broke down the priorities for the upcoming summit. First, he said, the group needed to agree on a coronavirus support package for low and middle-income countries that would accelerate the vaccination of populations worldwide. “If the vaccine stuff isn’t done, that just rumbles through and takes up all the political energy for the rest of the year,” Mabey said. Dealing with coronavirus, he stressed, was a “necessary condition to be able to have a conversation about climate” at the COP26 summit, scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.,The second area that the G7 needed to deliver on, Mabey said, was climate policy. Here, the G7’s meeting of environment ministers, held online last month, has ,already produced some results,. At that meeting, ministers agreed to take actions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century (a marked increase in ambition over the previous target of 2 degrees). The nations also pledged to stop all funding of coal-fired power stations in developing countries from this year, and committed to protecting 30% of land in a bid to safeguard biodiversity. “We hope the leaders will go further on coal, cementing in a rapid phase down of coal by 2030,” Mabey said.,It was hoped the G7 and developed nations would also begin providing $100 billion of climate finance per year for developing countries, a promise first made a full 12 years ago at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. ,The third set of demands, Mabey said, was “perhaps the biggest and most important: this is about how the majority of the investment in resilient infrastructure is actually going to happen.” This would require large-scale financing via multinational development banks, as well as restructuring debt. “It makes sense if we say we’re going to increase the capital that multilateral development banks have, so there’s, say, double the amount of finance available, on the condition that it goes to green investments,” Mabey said. “That would be a serious offer. Without financing it’s going to be seen as a paper tiger.”,Despite the huge political and economic challenges of hashing out a deal, Mabey did see cause for optimism in the sense that NGOs and intergovernmental groups were largely on the same page about what needed to be done.  ,“The most interesting thing we've seen in the last six months is a very clear coming together of development and environment groups around a Covid-and-climate agenda for this G7, which hasn't really happened since the ‘90s Rio summit,” he said, referencing the crucial 1992 Earth Summit that helped define the modern conception of global sustainable development. Part of that change, Mabey thought, had been actuated by the pandemic itself.  “Development people now understand that without climate change being solved there’s no development, and climate people realize without solving Covid there's no space to talk about climate,” he said. “Instead of fighting over the recovery money, there’s been a relatively mature attitude of ‘no, we need to get people up off the floor first and get economies back together.’ The climate [agenda] not trying to muscle to the front of the queue has been pretty important.”,But how hopeful should climate advocates be that the G7 will deliver what’s needed?,“At the political level I think there’s pressure to rebuild the transatlantic bridge [between the U.S. and Europe], for Biden to show America is back, and for the U.K. to show they’re still in the global game,” Mabey said. “That kind of geopolitical driver is very powerful.”,But the more challenging hurdle would be the detail; the mechanisms to bring promises to reality, including structural reform of the multilateral banks as well as the aforementioned increase in funding. “If the G7 are serious about mobilizing money at scale, they’ll need to follow it up much more actively with stronger institutional architecture, rather than just a communique decision,” Mabey said. ,“If they fail, it’s a very big fail because of how much the G7 needs to get done.”,The G7 Summit will take place at Carbis Bay, Cornwall, U.K. from Friday 11 through Sunday 13."
"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

Why Esports Team Misfits Is Prioritizing Mental Health For Players And Staff,"The Misfits team is already benefiting from the changes. ,The esports industry is a tough place to work. While it may look like a lot of fun and games, the stress levels and pressure can be massive, not just for the players who obviously have to perform and stay mentally strong in order to succeed and stay in a job, but also for the behind the scenes staff and those working in the industry in every sector. Despite it still being a relatively young industry countless talented people have already left the esports scene due to burnout, stress and the toll that it can take on your mental health. But finally, some companies in the space are starting to take notice. ,While most professional teams hire psychologists and countless other staff to make sure their pro players are always in top shape to perform on stage, few offer the same services to the other people they employ who keep the organization running and making money. But Misfits Gaming Group (MGG) is leading the charge when it comes to offering similar services to its day to day staff as well as the players, bringing in licenced psychologist Dr Carolyn Rubenstein as Chief Wellness Adviser. ,“I’ve been a part of MGG since day one in a supportive capacity, my husband is Ben Spoont [Misfits founder and CEO,] so I’ve seen the organization expand and flourish into a multi-team company with staff all over the world,” says Rubenstein. “I’ve watched the organization grow exponentially over the past few years and with that the need for sophisticated mental health and well-being support. In order to continue to grow as an organization and within each competitive league, well-being and culture have become primary areas of focus. I’m thrilled to be able to develop a unique program from the ground up in such a supportive environment. I’m hopeful that MGG will be a pioneer for other esports organizations to create executive leadership roles focused on mental health.”,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is making some big changes at Misfits ,Rubenstein of course spends a lot of time working with the pro players that Misfits employs, developing unique strategies for each team and individual to make sure they are in the best place they can be mentally. This can range from simply making sure they are equipped to deal with the stress high-level competition can bring, to developing personalized plans for dealing with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, then identifying other professionals that can help solve those issues. It’s an approach that will end up costing significantly more than trying to find a single person to work with all players, but it is a cost she believes is worth every penny. ,“Pro players are relying on their brains to perform and be on for very precise moments,” says Rubenstein. “This is a lot of pressure and can create anxiety which impacts focus. So in order to access all their skills and logical reasoning, emotions must be managed in-game and out of game. If not, emotions can overcome logical reasoning which can lead to tilting.  Most major psychological disorders like anxiety or depression impact focus and concentration and general functioning, so if not treated correctly impact performance. These disorders are treatable but are often neglected due to lack of awareness of the signs and treatment criteria.”,One of the first teams to benefit from her wisdom has been the Misfits League of Legends team, which plays in the LEC. Through meeting with the players and the coaching staff Rubenstein was able to create individualised plans for each of the players, to give them help and support when it comes to the mental side of being a pro player, and already the team is seeing results. ,“Throughout my experience working with teams and players, it was a welcome change to work with Carolyn and learn more about her approach to well-being within the organization,” said Martin “Deficio” Lynge, Director of Misfits Gaming Europe. “She has helped us to identify that there is not a fix-all solution for an esports team. Each individual is different and should be treated as such. Through working with Carolyn, we have been able to identify the different ways in which individual players prefer to work and communicate and develop a strong training strategy that resonates with each individual, to strengthen the collective power of the team.”,Martin ""Deficio"" Lynge has already seen the benefits of mental health support in the League of ,... [+], Legends department. ,Rubenstein is no doubt doing some very important work with the pro players, and while it seems that her approach is taking more of a focus on wellbeing than results, unlike some other psychologists in the space who are mostly focused on performance, it is her work with the staff of MGG that will hopefully set a new standard in esports. ,“Surprising to me, but also not surprising when looked at from afar, [is that] the issues [players and staff experience] are very similar,” says Rubenstein. “Esports is a competitive field as a whole that quickly changes, so there is a lot of pressure at all levels. The impact of chronic pressure and stress is definitely felt across the board. It’s important for our staff, just as much as our players, to consider their mental well-being. More awareness needs to be raised around stress, anxiety and burnout and how to identify signs early.”,Despite only joining the organisation officially a few months ago, Rubenstein has already had an impact on a number of Misfits staff. Many have talked with her personally about issues they are having, while others, and even some outside of the organisation, have been helped by her insightful ,social media accounts,. ,Normalising the conversation around mental health within esports, for both players and those working within the space, is an important step in moving forward. While the topic is certainly more discussed and accepted in esports more than in many other industries, the competitive nature of the scene makes it difficult for some to speak out about their issues. Many, myself included, have been forced to take time away from esports, or even leave entirely, due to mental health issues and have felt like they are unable to explain the reasons behind it. By working with Misfits, and continuing to talk publicly about mental health issues within esports, Rubenstein hopes that the attitudes towards mental health in esports will start to change. ,Dr Carolyn Rubenstein is looking to change the conversation when it comes to mental health in ,... [+], esports. ,“Within MGG, I’ve been surprised by how open the pro players and staff have been to talking about mental health,” says Rubenstein. “I think it helps that they know they are talking to a trained professional so they feel comfortable and safe opening up. Also, coming back to that core family atmosphere we’re trying to foster at MGG, a big part of that is providing a safe and encouraging working environment for staff/players, one where they won’t get punished for talking about mental health, and they can be vulnerable.”,“Within esports as a whole, vulnerability can be treated differently,” adds Rubenstein. “So I think it’s important for anyone opening up about mental health to consider the environment in which they are doing so and to prioritize safety when doing so. Generally speaking, normalizing talking about mental health is a key factor in helping to remove stigma around sharing feelings. On many occasions, people can feel the same way and experience the same pressures but without talking about it, they can be left feeling isolated and alone.” ,For those within the Misfits Gaming Group, there is no doubt that the addition of Rubenstein will be a massive benefit. While the players may be able to gain a slight competitive advantage, the work she is doing across the whole organization is what should be really celebrated, and will hopefully lead to a much more happy and efficient group of staff within the organization. For those outside of Misfits, the hope is that the success of Rubenstein's work will eventually inspire other teams and companies in the space to make similar hires and further help everyone in the esports space that struggles with mental health. ,For anyone, inside or outside of esports, that is suffering with mental health issues, Rubenstein’s number one bit of advice is to speak to a professional as soon as possible, saying that even one session with a trained professional can be a big help."
BTS Now Claim The Three Largest Streaming Weeks In The History Of Billboard’s Global Chart,"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - FEBRUARY 21: (L-R) J-Hope, SUGA, Jungkook, Jimin, RM, V, and Jin of the K-pop ,... [+], boy band BTS visit the ""Today"" Show at Rockefeller Plaza on February 21, 2020 in New York City. (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images),BTS control the Billboard Global 200 chart once again this week, as their new single “Butter” doesn’t move an inch. The tune started off at No. 1 last frame, and now it’s a steady ruler, claiming not only another stint atop the tally, but one of the largest streaming sums in the history of the worldwide list.,Thanks to their performance in the previous tracking frame, BTS now claim the three largest streaming sums in the history of ,Billboard,’s weekly ranking of the most-consumed songs in the world. The group has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 with four tracks, and two of them have accrued truly eye-popping streaming counts.,Last week, “Butter” absolutely smashed the previous record for the largest streaming sum on the Billboard Global 200. The summer-ready track opened at No. 1 with ,289.2 million, plays. It still stand as the only cut to rack up at least 200 million streams globally in just seven days, and it almost doubled the best showing that came before it (more on that in a moment).,This frame, “Butter” holds at No. 1 thanks to another week of healthy sales and ,169.8 million, plays on streaming platforms all around the world. That number now stands as the second-largest stream count yet in the history of the Billboard Global 200.,The third-largest streaming sum seen on the Billboard Global 200 in the almost-year it’s been around also belongs to BTS, but they managed it with a different song. Last December, the South Korean septet blasted onto the ranking at No. 1 with “Life Goes On,” which instantly became their third leader on the tally. The Korean-language smash arrived with 152.2 million streams, which stood as the most impressive figure when looking solely at plays on streaming sites until “Butter” debuted.,When compiling the weekly Billboard Global 200 chart, ,Billboard, takes into account both plays on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer and many others, as well as sales. A track typically needs sizable counts of both to hit No. 1, or overwhelming popularity on either format to lead the charge."
‘Loki’ Episode 1 Is An Hour Of Explaining What ‘Loki’ Will Be About,"Loki,Loki episode 1 has gone up on ,Disney Plus this morning,, a return to a weekly Marvel and/or Star Wars series we can all overanalyze to death. And I can’t wait.,We’re opening with a 50+ minute episode, so we are not doing WandaVision-style shorter entries, it seems. But even though this was half the length of a movie, Loki needs to spend a ,whole, lot of time explaining what exactly it is, and what it will be doing over the course of this first season, and possibly the second season, which has already been greenlit.,Spoilers follow.,If you watched the trailer, you get the gist of it. During the events of Avengers Endgame, Loki manages to escape his “correct” timeline using the Tesseract. But he doesn’t know that, and is confused when he’s abducted by the Time Variance Authority (the TVA) and brought to a strange, Twin Peaks-looking place where his magic doesn’t work.,Loki is informed that as a Variant, he’s screwed up the “Sacred Timeline” which must now be rectified. Loki, being the arrogant god he is, believes none of this, but slowly comes to terms with it over the course of the episode, and once he sees a box full of Infinity Stones that the office uses as paperweights, he starts to wonder if the TVA somehow ,is, the most powerful force in the universe.,Loki,It’s…a whole lot of exposition. Don’t get me wrong, I like Loki, we all like Loki, and that’s the reason it still works. It’s also helped along by Owen Wilson as Mobius who makes a surprisingly perfect foil to Loki, who is forced to come to terms with his ambitions, his motivations and his ultimate “correct” timeline fate.,But the idea is that maybe there’s a way ,this, version of Loki can exist and ,not, have his neck eventually snapped by Thanos. There’s a dangerous Variant lurking around that Mobius eventually reveals is…Loki himself, which obviously raises an entire host of questions.,Some of the Qs that immediately come to mind after viewing this episode:,Loki,Finally, I know that everyone was speculating that WandaVision would be the catalyst to create the “Multiverse of Madness” that will be the main purpose of Doctor Strange 2 and open the door to multiple Spider-Men in Far From Home. That didn’t happen, but here? I mean, come on, this ,has, to be the genesis for that storyline. In the little TVA explainer video, they talk about how there used to be a multiverse with warring timelines that had to be merged into the sacred one. And if a Variant is allowed to rampage around unchecked, their decisions and impact could spawn another multiverse, which is why the TVA needs to stop them. Since was ,are, getting a multiverse, it’s clear the TVA doesn’t succeed. So is that the main point of Loki season 1? Does evil Loki set all the events of the coming multiverse, multi-movie plotline in motion? It certainly seems possible, and this doesn’t feel like WandaVision speculation this time.,Anyway, I liked the first episode, exposition heavy or not. It’s clearly going to be an extremely weird series and unlike anything else in the MCU, which I think is just fine after a more traditional run of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. ,More to come next Wednesday, see you then.,Follow me ,on Twitter,, ,YouTube,, ,Facebook, and ,Instagram,.,Subscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter, ,God Rolls,.,Pick up my sci-fi novels the ,Herokiller series,, and ,The Earthborn Trilogy,, which is also on ,audiobook,."
Look Closely—That’s A Stealth Fighter On China’s Pretend Aircraft Carrier Deck,"An FC-31 on the Type 003 mock-up in Wuhan.,The Chinese navy is building a new aircraft carrier. And there are strong indications that it plans to load up the huge flattop with stealth fighters.,If that’s the case, the People’s Liberation Army Navy will be only the second navy in the world, after America’s, to embark a low-observable warplane on a catapult-equipped carrier.,After a 14-year saga involving a bargain-bin purchase from Ukraine followed by painstaking renovations, in 2012 China commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the second-hand CNS ,Liaoning. ,Seven years later, the PLAN commissioned its first locally built flattop CNS ,Shandong,, a slightly-modified copy of ,Liaoning,. ,The 1,033-foot carriers each embark a couple dozen J-15 fighters, which are Chinese clones of the decidedly non-stealthy Russian Su-33. Both flattops lack catapults, however—they launch their planes via a bow ramp. That limits how much fuel and weaponry a J-15 can carry.,The PLAN is about to remedy that problem, it seems.,The new Type 003 carrier, which has been under construction at a shipyard in Shanghai since 2016, features two catapults on its bow. Launching planes via catapult instead of a ramp allows them to carry full loads of weapons and fuel.,Beijing appears to be moving swiftly to exploit the Type 003’s greater potential. The PLAN is developing a twin-engine radar early warning plane that’s similar to the American E-2. The KJ-600 radar plane clearly is too heavy for ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,but should work just fine from the Type 003. ,The latest hint that the PLAN might also embark stealth fighters on the Type 003 comes in the form of ,a grainy photo, that someone snapped at a Chinese navy test facility in Wuhan.,It’s there in Wuhan that the PLAN builds mock-ups of its new warship designs in order to experiment with sensor layouts. The Wuhan site includes a concrete version of a Type 055 cruiser as well as a copy of part of the Type 003’s flight deck.,The new photo of the concrete Type 003 reveals a recent addition to the unflyable planes arrayed on the mock deck. In addition to a pair of mock J-15s and a KJ-600, there’s an FC-31. ,The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been developing the twin-engine FC-31 as a smaller, lighter and potentially cheaper complement to the Chengdu J-20, the Chinese air force’s first—and so far only—stealth fighter. ,There have been rumors that the PLAN has been eying the FC-31 as a possible carrier fighter. The type’s appearance in Wuhan is the strongest signal so far that those rumors are true.,The Type 003 could be commissioned as early as 2025, at which point the PLAN will have three carriers. ,Liaoning ,and ,Shandong ,probably still will be hauling around their tired J-15s, but the Type 003 could sail with a mix of J-15s, FC-31s and KJ-600s in addition to the usual helicopters.,If that kind of wing seems familiar, it’s because it’s close to matching the U.S. Navy’s own carrier air wings. The American wings soon also will include two kinds of fighters—one stealthy, one not—plus radar planes and ‘copters.,Which is not to say the Chinese wing will possess all the capabilities of its American counterpart. The U.S. Navy operates purpose-built radar-jamming jets, for one. It’s also fielding drone tankers for autonomous mid-air refueling. The Chinese navy has not yet begun developing similar aircraft."
"Leading U.S. Regulator Exposes Disunity In U.S. Crypto Strategy, Warns Of Innovation-Stifling Rules","A Trump-appointed financial regulator said she opposes efforts by her colleagues to impose stricter rules on cryptocurrencies and retail stock trading platforms for fear of stifling innovation, highlighting disunity among leaders of America’s top financial watchdogs as they decide if, and how, to manage the volatile crypto market as it continues to move into the mainstream. ,Hester Peirce ,Hester Peirce, one of five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, ,told, the ,Financial Times, she did not believe the gut instinct to regulate crypto markets in the same way as existing assets will be “great for innovation.”,Peirce said “pretty effective self-regulation” is possible for the type of peer-to-peer transactions characterizing cryptocurrencies and could stand in for government regulation. ,Peirce’s comments highlight disagreement among and within America’s leading financial regulators over how best to manage crypto assets, ,and conflicts, with calls for more thorough regulation from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler. ,Gensler recently ,told, a House committee there was a potential need for dedicated legislation governing crypto exchanges, particularly to manage money laundering and illicit activities.  ,Peirce’s stance also puts her in ,conflict, with former President Donald Trump, who appointed her as commissioner, who recently called for very strict regulation and described Bitcoin as a “scam.”,Peirce also offered countervailing thoughts to the criticism that retail trading platforms like Robinhood ,gamify, trading to keep customers engaged, suggesting it is “not necessarily a bad thing” to make the platforms “look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”,Peirce said the SEC could learn a lot from games in getting its messages to consumers across. “We need to gamify our communications with investors,” she said. “We need to meet them where they are.”,The novel challenges of cryptocurrencies, alongside highly volatile markets, high risks of financial crime and rapid growth into the mainstream, make it a prime target for financial regulators around the world. As the division within the SEC highlights, trade offs are often framed as being between encouraging innovation and investment or implementing stringent regulatory safeguards.

New U.S. International Entrepreneur Program Dead End Without Road To Green Card,"Foreign entrepreneurs with their new ideas are critical to the U.S. economy. What is the best way to ,... [+], attract them?,The U.S. International Entrepreneur Program,In the June/July 2021 issue of ,Forbes, magazine, staff writer Amy Feldman pointed out that, “Foreign-born entrepreneurs are key to the success of this nation. ,Some 3.2 million of them, operate businesses in the United States, representing nearly 22% of all business owners versus just 14% of the broader population. They hold ,disproportionate numbers of patents, for new technologies, employ 8 million people and are represented as founders at ,more than half ,of all venture-backed unicorns, ,including Databricks,., The author added, “An analysis of the ,Forbes ,Billionaires list found 77 foreign-born entrepreneurs who built U.S. companies with combined revenue of over $528 billion and total employment of more than 775,000. Among the corporate heavyweights with immigrant founders: Google 
 , 
  ,GOOG, 
 ,, Tesla 
 , 
  ,TSLA, 
 , and Yahoo.”,Recognizing the importance of encouraging such foreign entrepreneurs to come to the United States, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the ,International Entrepreneur program,. Under the program, the USCIS can grant “parole” to foreign entrepreneurs who must also prove they are bringing some significant public benefit to the U.S. The entrepreneurs can work only for their startups and for two and a half years, with the possibility of one extension. Their spouses and children are also eligible for parole. While spouses may apply for a work authorization, the children are not eligible to work. Such a parole can also be granted for up to three entrepreneurs per start-up entity.,U.S. immigration attorney Elizabeth Goss says the International Entrepreneur program is helpful to ,... [+], foreign students graduating from U.S. colleges who want to stay and start up companies.,The program was created in the Obama years, then all but cancelled under Trump, only to be reinstated by Biden. Elizabeth Goss, a Boston immigration attorney who works in this field and recently helped an entrepreneur enter the U.S. under the program, points out, “It is especially useful for foreign students who have graduated from U.S. colleges who are entrepreneurs and want to stay to establish their business here.” ,To succeed under this rule entrepreneurs must demonstrate that they possess an ownership interest in a start-up entity (at least 10%) created in the U.S. within the last five years that has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation evidenced by either: ,(a) ,significant capital, investment (at least $250,000) from U.S. investors with established track records, ,(b) significant ,awards or grants, (at least $100,000) from federal, state or local government agencies; or ,(c) show ,other “reliable and compelling evidence,” to merit approval, such as admission into a highly competitive startup accelerator.,A spouse of an entrepreneur applying for parole under this rule must also demonstrate that he or she is independently eligible for parole based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and merits a favorable exercise of discretion.,In assessing the effectiveness of such a program, it is sometimes helpful to compare it with a similar program operating elsewhere. The Canadian ,start-up visa program, is a similar successful immigration initiative that can serve this purpose. Let’s consider how that program is run to determine the value of the American program and to see if there are ways it might be improved.,Contrasting Two Programs ,The Canadian start-up program is designed to spur the economy and encourage growth like the American ,... [+], International Entrepreneur program.,Under the Canadian program, there are three ways the intending immigrant entrepreneur can qualify:,1) Be accepted into a ,business incubator, program that will work with the entrepreneur to prepare a business plan for the project. The incubator seems to be the most popular option, and usually involves a payment to the incubator by the entrepreneur of say about $ 70,000 U.S. ($ 100,000 Canadian) to get the incubator involved. It also involves spending some 4 to 6 months in Canada and working with the incubator group to perfect the plan, or,2) Get the support of a government designated ,angel investor, group to invest under $ 60,000 U.S. ($ 75,000 Canadian) in a project, or,3) Get the support of a government designated ,venture capital fund, group to invest just over $ 150,000 U.S. ($ 200,000 Canadian) in a project.,In each case, the entrepreneur must end up owning at least 10 percent of the voting shares in the Canadian company incorporated to do the project, and must become actively involved in its management. No other person can hold 50 percent or more of the voting shares in the enterprise.,If the entrepreneur meets these requirements, he or she will get a ,letter of support or a commitment certificate, from the sponsoring group that will open the Canadian doors to your immigration. Processing of such a permanent resident immigration application will take about 18 months. However, once the entrepreneur has gained the written support for the start-up, they can immediately apply for a short-term work permit to work on the project. A spouse can also get an open work permit, children can go to school at no cost and all the family can get free health care after about three months from their entry into Canada.,The biggest difference between the two start-up programs is that the Canadian program leads to permanent residence, while the U.S. International Entrepreneur parole offers applicants only a temporary status of two and a half years with one renewal, or in other words a maximum 5 years. There is no clear path to permanent residence with the U.S. program. Canada also allows the spouse and children to work, while the U.S. allows only the spouse to obtain work authorization, but not the children. The U.S. program includes a needlessly onerous requirement that the spouse also make a showing of public benefit or humanitarian need to be granted parole. Although applicants for the Canadian visa usually undergo more scrutiny and a much lengthier application process, U.S. applicants can petition for their parole and receive it at right at the U.S. port of entry. However, until America offers a more definite way to convert parole to permanent residence, relative ease of entry is of little value.,When compared to other U.S. immigration programs available to entrepreneurs, such as the E-2, L-1, EB-5 or even O-1 visas, the International Entrepreneurship program falls short in what it offers prospective applicants. Unfortunately, it has not been thought out well, is too demanding in terms of eligibility criteria for the benefits offered and is unlikely to do well in attracting foreign entrepreneurs for that reason."
Billy Horschel Launches New APGA Tour Event To Promote Diversity In Golf,"Mulbe Dillard (right) fist bumps Jabir Bilal after finishing the first round of an APGA Tour event ,... [+], at World Golf Village on July 9, 2020. (Photo by Keyur Khamar/PGA TOUR via Getty Images),Growing up in Grant, Florida, ,Billy Horschel, didn’t come from a lot of money. He and brothers Chris and Brian were taught by their parents, Bill and Kathy, that if someone needed help, you helped them, which often meant offering a friendly hand cleaning up debris from a hurricane that passed through the rural town along the Indian River Lagoon on Florida’s Atlantic coast.,As he got more interested and involved in golf, a young Horschel would play Brevard County courses at discounted rates thanks to the county’s junior golf program. Even though he’d save money on greens fees, he still missed out on some opportunities other rising golfers and their families were able to afford.,“My parents may not have had money to always buy me new equipment, clothes, shoes or golf balls all the time; that’s why I still only play with one sleeve of balls each round,” Horschel said. “I’m used to making a ball last as long as it possibly could because we couldn’t always afford golf balls.”,Thanks to a standout career at the University of Florida, the former All-American was able to continue to ascend through golf’s ranks, reaching its apex in 2011. With six PGA Tour victories and a 2014 FedEx Cup to his name, Horschel continues to lend a helping hand, providing the next generation of golfers with an opportunity to hopefully have the same success he’s had.,Together with Cisco, Horschel is hosting the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational from July 29-31 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. ,The event will feature an 18-man field with nine players from the APGA Tour Player Development Program, five graduates from the APGA Collegiate Ranking, the current top-ranked player in the APGA Collegiate Ranking, and three sponsor’s exemptions.,It isn’t all just about golf though. The event will also have an initial day of a pro-am, roundtable, seminars and other development opportunities all with key partners and industry leaders. The competition will challenge the players with 36 holes at The Players Stadium Course, home of ,The Players Championship,.,“Our guys hear all the time that, ‘It’s not possible. You need to get a job. Guys where you come from can’t make it,’ but you see a guy like Billy who grew up similarly to how they grew up and had to struggle and still fights for everything he gets, so they see him and the possibilities out there,” APGA CEO Ken Bentley said. “The other part that I try to get through to them is once you go through a door, you have to open it wider so more people come through. ,“When you have a guy like Billy who financially is set for life and he’s taking his time to help them, it reinforces the message we’re trying to get across to our guys: you have to constantly reach back to help those who need the help. He’s an example of a guy who’s made it, is successful and his road is one they can emulate, but he’s also a guy who wants to give back and help others.”,Billy Horschel is a six-time PGA Tour winner and the 2014 FedEx Cup champion.,Horschel was introduced to APGA golfer Willie Mack III during a First Tee clinic with Rickie Fowler in San Diego in 2020. The two chatted about the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour, a non-profit organization established in 2008 with a mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf.,Thinking about the obstacles golfers face along their journey to the professional ranks while learning more about the ,APGA Tour,, Horschel began to take action. Not only is he fulfilling a dream of his to hold a professional golf event—he has the Billy Horschel Junior Championship on the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)—he is providing opportunities for up-and-coming golfers to not only find success on the course, but off it as well.,Despite not having a prior personal connection or relationship, he reached out to the team at Cisco to see if they would be interested in being part of the event; they joined as presenting sponsor. Horschel also got good friend and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who is also chairman and owner of the PGA Tour Superstore, as well as Concession Golf Club owner Bruce Cassidy on board.,“The great thing about golf is you connect with so many different people in this game and they’re willing to help,” Horschel said. “With connections that we have on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour, if golf doesn’t work out, here are people we connected with to help us transition and mentor us in our next journey in life. That was a big thing to me—to hold this event and give these guys a chance to chase their dream, see if they can succeed and ultimately get to PGA Tour, but if it doesn’t work out, I want to connect them to people I’ve come across that I know would love to help these players in their next journey in life.”,Technology giants Cisco have been involved in golf for a number of years. They have been a global partner of the United States Golf Association (USGA) since 2018, were partner of 2020’s The Match: Champions for Charity, and ,sponsor, nine pro golfers including the ,APGA’s Kamaiu Johnson,, so supporting Horschel’s APGA event was a no-brainer.,“At Cisco, our purpose is to power an inclusive future for all, and if you think about what the APGA is doing and what Billy is trying to do with this particular tournament, I think it intersects quite well in terms of really driving more inclusivity,” said Mark Patterson, Cisco senior vice-president and Chief of Staff to the Chairman and CEO.,Invited players to the event include: Ryan Alford, Marcus Byrd, Jarred Garcia, Michael Hererra, Kamaiu Johnson, Willie Mack III, Joey Stills, Davin White, Rovanta Young, Mulbe Dillard, Andrew Walker, Mahindra Lutchman, Cameron Riley, and Prince Cunningham.,Dillard, who recently concluded a record-setting collegiate career at Florida A&M University where he finished atop the APGA Tour Collegiate Ranking, made his professional golf debut at the REX Hospital Open on the Korn Ferry Tour on June 3.,“Golf is definitely a sport I feel needs to be a little bit more diverse,” Dillard said. “Events like this definitely help in terms of people who may not have the funding because funding is definitely one of the leading reasons why people don’t continue their golf career as far as they want to. Events like this definitely give people an opportunity to be exposed to sponsors and for people to see what they can actually do.”,Kamaiu Johnson will be in the 18-man field for the inaugural Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational. ,...

Tilton/Getty Images),Added Johnson: “I always preach that if you make these connections and meet these CEOs, you can never go back to where you used to be because they’re going to make sure you’re successful. It’s important for us, especially for me. I never want to go back to where I used to be.”,Not only does this event offer the invited golfers a chance to make business and sponsorship connections to further their careers, it also gives them an opportunity to play on a championship-style golf course. ,Bentley said it was a priority of the APGA to put their players in situations on courses they’d play if they were on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour. This season, the APGA has events on two courses that have hosted PGA Tour major tournaments (Valhalla and Torrey Pines) as well as six others on TPC courses.,In order to achieve the five-year goal of placing a golfer on the PGA Tour, the APGA Tour also began a player development program that assists with lessons, equipment and entry fees, while top golf coaches and instructors including Todd Anderson, Sean Foley, John Graham and Jon Hardesty have donated their services to help APGA golfers get to the next level.,“What we’ve been able to create is a village of people and companies that really support this whole idea of giving more people an opportunity and that’s what this is all about—just giving guys the opportunity,” Bentley said. “No one is guaranteeing you make it to the PGA Tour, but you change a life if you 1) say, ‘I believe in you,’ which is what they’re saying by supporting this and 2) ‘I’m going to give you the opportunity to realize your dream.’ ,“They might not make it to the PGA Tour, but I’m 99% sure they’ll be successful in life.”,The 34-year-old Horschel, who has raked in more than $28 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, understands that making golf more available and accessible whether in the United States, Mexico or China can lead to more opportunities within the ropes and outside of them not only for the players, but everyone involved.,It’s also why he proudly confirmed that the Billy Horschel APGA Tour Invitational won’t just be a one-off event, saying the focus is to build the foundation for this event that will ensure long-term success.,“I want to help anyone I can and have an impact,” he said. “If I help one person in this life and I made a difference in that person’s life, then my life’s been a success.”"
Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."
Michigan Governor Whitmer's Pipeline Move Declares War On Aviation,"Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer introduces Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden to speak ,...

  ,ENB, 
 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."

Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."
"At The Department Of Energy, ‘Process’ Takes A Back Seat To Politics","The clock on a microwave oven is regulated by the Department of Energy.,The Department of Energy (DOE) is ,proposing, to rescind a rule implemented by the Trump Administration that would have imposed additional procedural obligations on the agency before adopting new energy standards. The move likely signals a flurry of new energy efficiency activity in the months ahead, and it forms part of a larger effort by the Biden Administration to roll back good-governance reforms implemented during the Trump years.,The DOE issues dozens of energy standards for appliances and other consumer and business equipment. These regulations affect everything from ceiling fans to that little clock on your microwave oven. The DOE also regulates “test procedures,” which determine how to measure a product’s energy usage. It turns out that measuring energy use can be even trickier than setting an energy standard, given the wide variety of ways people use products, as well as differences in product design.,In 1996, the Clinton DOE finalized a “process rule” that outlined a set of predictable steps that the DOE would take before issuing a final energy standard. These sensible steps included things like early engagement with the public, analysis of impacts, and consulting with experts.* The ,process rule, was not binding, however, so not all the recommended stages were guaranteed to happen. Despite that limitation, the rule did give businesses some certainty as to what to expect when the DOE sets out to regulate them. ,In 2020—after a ,years-long, period of stakeholder engagement—the Trump Administration ,formally amended, the process rule. First, it made the process rule binding on the DOE. This meant that, unlike with the 1996 regulation, a new energy efficiency rule could end up in trouble legally if DOE failed to follow the established process. This would hopefully spur DOE to take the procedures more seriously.,Next, the 2020 rule required the DOE to consider a wider variety of options before settling on an energy standard. This was intended to bolster the benefits of these policies and reduce costs. The DOE’s current approach is to follow a “walk-down” process, whereby the agency first finds the maximum achievable energy efficiency standard given current technology. If that standard has costs in excess of benefits, then the DOE “walks down” the standard until it finds one that is “economically justified,” which in practice tends to mean has benefits that exceed costs.,The problem with this approach is that from an economic standpoint, it makes much more sense to look for the option with the ,most, benefits in excess of costs, thereby achieving the most bang for consumer and business bucks. Instead, DOE interprets its legal obligations as meaning it should identify the most stringent option with ,any, benefits over costs—no matter how small the difference might be.,The 2020 process rule would also require the DOE to engage early with stakeholders, through requests for information or advance notices that a new standard is being considered. Too often, once a regulation is formally proposed by an agency, the regulating department has already made up its mind about what it wants to do. The commenting process creates an illusion that the public can make a meaningful difference, but it frequently comes too late to matter. ,Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and West Virginia Sen.

It follows a similar ,proposed action, in March that would rescind a ,Trump-era regulation, that sets procedures for DOE guidance documents. “Guidance” is a catch-all term for the various notices that regulatory agencies issue that aren’t formally regulations, but that often have effects like regulations. For example, updating a “Frequently Asked Questions” section on an agency website might result in thousands of firms adjusting their business practices. Beyond attorneys, few people look up the actual text of a regulation in the code, so a website can be more influential than the official law. ,FAQ websites and similar agency documentation don’t have to go through the same standard of review as a regulation, and therefore can skirt checks and balances in the rulemaking process. These checks include things like the commenting process, analysis requirements, or review by the Office of Management and Budget. If kept in place, the guidance regulation would have brought more of this informal-yet-influential rulemaking activity under traditional rulemaking procedures. ,To its credit, the Biden DOE has—at least thus far—maintained a ,website, that houses DOE guidance documents. Some ,agencies, have been making their guidance less visible in recent months, in a major blow to transparency. ,The Small Business Administration, a government agency tasked with advocating on behalf of small businesses, is ,pushing, the Biden DOE to reconsider its blunt decision to repeal the Trump process reforms, but don’t expect the agency to change course much. The Biden Administration’s climate agenda is a top priority. That means seemingly boring good-governance reforms related to guidance and rulemaking procedures will likely be swept away for the sake of political expediency. It’s arguably good politics, but a bad deal for consumers and businesses. ,- -,The author currently serves on the Appliance Standards and Rulemaking Federal Advisory Committee, which gives advice to the Department of Energy about its energy standards."
NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."
"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Record For The Largest Sales Week Of 2021 With An Old Release,"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift attends the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los ,... [+], Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."
"3 In 10 Republicans Believe Wacky Conspiracy Theory Trump Will Be ‘Reinstated’ As President This Year, Poll Shows","While most Americans dismiss the possibility, a significant chunk of Republicans believe the conspiracy theory buoyed by some of Donald Trump’s allies (and, reportedly, believed by the former president himself) that he’ll be back in the White House by the end of the year, a poll published Wednesday suggests. ,Former U.S. President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower in Manhattan on May 18, 2021 in New York City. ,... [+], ,The ,Politico,/Morning Consult ,survey, of 1,990 registered voters found respondents were broadly dismissive of the notion Trump could be “reinstated” as president. ,A decisive majority (72%) across the political spectrum deemed it “not very likely” or “not likely at all” Trump will have his old job by the end of the year. ,However, self-identified Republicans were less quick to dismiss the conspiracy theory. ,While 61% of GOP respondents labeled Trump’s return unlikely, some 29% said they believe he will be made president again. ,This compares to 84% of the Democrats surveyed who said Trump won’t be reinstated and 13% who said he will be. ,All in all, 19% of the people surveyed for the poll said it was either “somewhat likely” or “very likely” Trump will be reinstated as president this year. ,The conspiracy theory Trump will be reinstated as president, which has become popular among ,QAnon believers,, stems from the false claims still being pushed by some Republicans that the 2020 election was rigged. Trump has ,reportedly, become fixated with the ongoing GOP-commissioned election audit in Arizona and is pushing for similar ballot reviews across the country, telling allies (though daughter-in-law Lara Trump has since ,denied, this) the success of the recounts could result in his return to the White House this year. Of course, election officials across the country have maintained that last year’s presidential election was one of the safest in history and have denied the possibility it was marred by widespread fraud. ,As ,Forbes, has previously ,reported,, some of Trump’s more outlandish supporters and allies have advocated for antidemocratic maneuvers to seize control of the White House. Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn ,called, for a Myanmar-style military coup at a QAnon conference late last month (he has since walked back the comments). ,“Lara Trump Dismisses Reports Trump Believes He Will Be Reinstated In August” ,(Forbes) ,“Maggie Haberman: Trump Telling People He Expects To Be ‘Reinstated’ As President By August”, (Forbes) ,“Trump Says GOP Will Retake Congress, White House ‘Sooner Than You Think’ In Fundraising Video”, (Forbes)"

Exclusive: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Encourages Small Businesses To ‘Stay The Course’ As The Economy Accelerates,"David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs in New York in 2019,Through the initiative, which counts Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and Mary Barra among its advisors, the banking behemoth has provided training and financing to 10,000 entrepreneurs who have collectively generated $14 billion in revenue and employed more than 200,000 workers over the past 10 years. Since the start of the pandemic, its partners have allocated over $1 billion toward nearly 26,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans to help small business owners navigate the unprecedented economic environment. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer,” says Solomon. “It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.”,For Tisha Skinner, 46, who owns multiple Smoothie King franchises in the Baltimore area, those resources proved to be a lifeline. “Being a small business owner, I sometimes feel like I’m on an island by myself,” says Skinner, who filed for bankruptcy during the Great Recession. She believes her participation in the program helped her secure over $500,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Restaurant Revitalization Act. “Having the Goldman Sachs program there to help me think through decisions and make the right ones was a huge help...it renewed my confidence,” she says. “Now, I call myself a grant queen.”,She’s not alone in her confidence. According to a survey of participants in the 10,000 Small Business Program released Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, 78% believe this year will be better than last, with 70% saying operations have already returned to normal or will by the third quarter. ,“We shut down the economy. Immediately, we turned the light switch off. You can’t just turn the light switch on—it’s like a dimmer. It’s going to take some time, so we have to make sure we’re getting the right resources to small businesses.” ,After one of the toughest years on record for the nation’s more than 30 million small businesses, the majority (70%) of respondents report feeling better equipped to navigate future downturns. At the height of the pandemic, over ,400,000 businesses had shuttered their doors,. Those who weathered the storm pivoted to meet the moment: 95% of owners adapted their business in some way, with 50% launching new products, services or sales strategies. More than a third of those in the hard-hit retail industry found new suppliers.,Meanwhile, emboldened by high unemployment, low interest rates and a surge in ,personal savings rates,, aspiring business owners tried their hand at entrepreneurship at the highest rate in decades. With nothing to lose, 4.5 million Americans bet on themselves and registered for new business applications—that’s a 35% jump from 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ,“The fact that people are willing to go out and risk their own money to start businesses in greater numbers indicates their confidence in the American dream,” Solomon says. “But that economic ecosystem of risk taking and allowing capital to get places where people have good ideas...that’s an important part of what differentiates America, and we need to continue to support that.”,Though cautiously optimistic that the economy is headed for a strong recovery, 49% of surveyed businesses have struggled to hire for fundamental roles, like those in sales, marketing, customer service and operations. When small employers account for 64% of new jobs created in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration, this is especially troubling. ,But Solomon, who likens hiring in this environment to a “hand-to-hand combat sport,” doesn’t think this will be a long-term trend. “It’s going to get easier to attract talent as we get into the fall, as some of the extended unemployment benefits roll off and the economy picks up,” he says. “Stay the course.”,While staying the course in anticipation of a strong economic rebound may be wise, the greatest challenge facing small businesses remains access to capital—even after nearly $1 trillion in federal stimulus and billions in corporate grant programs. Some 34% of business owners are looking to take on more debt over the coming year, according to Goldman Sachs’ report, but 53% are not confident they’ll be approved for a new line of credit. ,But would the venerable Goldman Sachs set its sights on disrupting the $800 billion small business lending space next? ,“We’re not a commercial lender,” he says. “It’s not a business we’ve been in. Might we be in it one day? We’ll see.”"
NFL’s Richard Sherman Teams Up With HealthTech Company Nurosene To Shed Light On Mental And Brain Health,"NFL's Richard Sherman teams up with Nurosene to shed light on mental and brain health.,HealthTech company ,Nurosene,, is on a mission to bring visibility to mental wellness using a brain-first approach. The company, which is focused on implementing healthy habits designed to align the mind, body and brain for daily mental wellness and overall brain health, announced it has teamed up with five-time NFL Pro Bowler Richard Sherman to support the company’s newly launched Nuro App. In addition, Sherman will serve as an ambassador for Nurosene’s approach to supporting brain health and continue on his journey of advocating for those struggling with mental health. ,Founded last year in May 2020 by brain researcher and functional neurologist Daniel Gallucci, Nurosene set out to improve mental wellness and brain health for all, just as people focus on their own nutrition or their physical health. Richard Sherman’s investment in Nurosene comes at a pivotal time when the light has only begun to be cast on the stigmas around mental health and wellness, and increasingly so due to the struggles during the pandemic. ,Sherman’s personal experience made it important for him to get involved with the Canadian-based company where he eventually become an ambassador. “I think this pandemic has really revealed a lot to a lot of people and a lot of the world during these difficult days,” Sherman stated. “When you're isolated, you are really forced to be in your own thoughts and in your own head,” he added. Gallucci, a former professional soccer player, exercise scientist and sports physiologist, also  shared with Forbes his deeper interest in how we truly understand the brain. When it comes to brain health, Gallucci believes the Nuro App will help to “position their brain health as the driver of their performance moving forward.” ,“More than ever, athletes realize that they're being pushed beyond their performance capacity physically and emotionally, at an intensity and a frequency that's never been seen before, and without the understanding of what that means not only for them contextually right at that moment for their own performance and behavior, but also their long term performance and behaviors, Gallucci adds.” ,Sherman, who has long been an advocate for mental health in sports and in the black community, feels that now is an important time to bring these issues to light and normalize them. “Mental health is one of those things, both culturally in the black community, but also culturally, it's kind of like the jockism, to just be tougher, and be stronger, and just get past it and don't think about it,'' he shared.  In this “get over it” type culture Sherman shares that it eventually  “compounds on itself.” ,As an athlete sometimes it means “letting it be known that we're all human,” Sherman says. “I think when you start to peel back the layers and really reveal yourself to people, it leads people to find help for themselves and liberates people that man, they're not alone in that thought process.” ,SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 24: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the San Francisco 49ers ,... [+], takes the field during player introductions prior to the game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on November 24, 2019 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images),“Another reason I partnered with Nurosene is that it really shows people that it's okay to have that conversation,” he adds. With Nurosene’s “brain-based approach” there is potential to open up more possibilities to help more people across the globe, but also more athletes, like Noami Osaka, who recently stepped away from her professional career in tennis to take time for her mental well-being, and get the tools they need to improve their overall brain health.  ,According to Gallucci, “It's the brain that drives your behavior, whether it's how fast your eyes move, whether it's how you get to sleep at night, these are constructs of the fundamental workings of your brain. And by putting those things at the beginning of the conversation, it increases the possibility of you being successful moving forward.” ,The Nuro App from Nurosene gives users different exercises, tools and programs focusing on movement, ,... [+], recovery, mental and brain health. ,Throughout Sherman’s NFL career, he has learned many lessons, but from a mental health perspective, he says one of the one of the ‘best and worst things’ that he has learned in sports is to try not to dwell on the past. “You can't dwell on the past, because you know, you learn from it really quickly, and you move forward with the experience that you have, and try to be better from it. And I think sometimes that forces me and forces humans to suppress things and just go past them in life.” ,According to Sherman, his involvement with Nurosene and its Nuro App was the perfect symbiosis of looking to really get into this space because of the pandemic, “You just really want to acknowledge and address the issue. I think it's going to be a fantastic tool that's gonna help a lot of people. I think it can have a positive impact on all age groups, because I think as kids, you're conditioned to think a certain way about mental health,” he added. “For kids, it really just shows that they're not alone, and I think some kids are so isolated, and alone, get in their own head and feel like there's no way out, and sometimes that leads to a terrible road, and a terrible future. And I think this gives them an out, this gives them hope.”,As of today, the company officially announced its IPO listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the ticker MEND for a total raise of $9.2M CAD, which was overscribed from the originally expected $5-8M CAD. “We're really excited to have Richard on board, as his passion for the community and support for those struggling, is really complementary to what we do,” said Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene. Bath shared that they are “building a generation of healthier brains.” To help focus beyond the nutritional side or physical training, Bath says the company has “built an ecosystem of tools inside an app, to help train and coach your brain on a daily basis, by incorporating basic fundamental things that increase blood flow to the brain.”  ,Ranj Bath, CEO of Nurosene.,The company also recently released its Nuro App, which is available for free on the Apple App store among others. The programs, tools and exercises are focused around the four pillars of movement, brain, nutrition and recovery. According to Bath, “We've digitized the entire clinical experience based around doing various kinds of brain training exercises often reserved for those with the means in private clinics. We're democratizing healthcare and want to make such critical tools available to everyone. Once an activity is complete, the Nurosene app aims to then analyze the way that the user interacts with the activities and assess potential future healthcare conditions or personalize the users program, to ensure they are on a path to rectify potential issues down the line,” Bath adds. ,“I think it's really cool how [mental health] has come to the forefront and is really being addressed in a positive way instead of being looked at as taboo or or being shunned. And I'm really excited to be a part of a positive movement that will hopefully change our lives for the better,” Sherman shares."
Renny Harlin Bonds With Pierce Brosnan For Gold Heist Film,"Pierce Brosnan (right) as Richard Pace, Rami Jaber as The Prince, Mike Angelo as Wick, Jamie Chung ,... [+], as Violet and Nick Cannon as Ringo star in the Renny Harlin action film, 'The Misfits.',Legendary action and horror filmmaker Renny Harlin had long wanted to collaborate with world-renowned Irish actor Pierce Brosnan, best known for playing the suave spy James Bond in four installments of the longrunning franchise. He finally had his wish granted with ,The Misfits,, an action-packed heist film in which Brosnan plays a cool and brilliant international thief who joins forces with a band of young, smart and savvy modern-day Robin Hoods.,Harlin, who hails from Finland and has a long list of credits including ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,, ,Die Hard 2,, ,Cliffhanger, and the 2016 Jackie Chan starrer ,Skiptrace,, assembled an eclectic group of international actors, including Mike Angelo (,Full House,), Rami Jaber (,Tough Love,), Hermione Corfield (,XXX: Return of Xander Cage),, Jamie Chung (,Lovecraft Country,, ,Dexter, reboot), Tim Roth (,Pulp Fiction), and Nick Cannon (,Drumline,). Producer Rami Jaber serves double duty as a producer and actor, playing an enigmatic character in the film known simply as The Prince., The heist crew proposes to serial prison escapee Richard Pace (Brosnan) that he join them in their plot to steal millions of dollars-worth of gold bars from a corrupt international private prison operator named Warner Schultz (Roth) who has stashed the loot for a terrorist organization at one of his facilities. Pace’s estranged daughter, Hope (Corfield) joins in the action and, over the course of their adventure, bonds with dad. Calling themselves The Misfits, the ring plans to steal the gold and then donate it to UNICEF. Each member of the group possesses a specific skill, such as Chung’s Violet is a martial arts expert while Mike Angelo’s character, Wick, is an energetic explosives expert, required to break into a highly fortified prison in Abu Dhabi, which contains a secured vault with the gold locked inside. Meanwhile Brosnan’s Pace uses his cunning to help orchestrate the operation to infiltrate the prison and steal the loot, all under Schultz’s nose.,From Sofia, Bulgaria, where the peripatetic filmmaker has just wrapped production on ,The Refuge,, a horror film involving the occult and a returning combat veteran, he is eager to talk up ,The Misfits,, which is mostly set in Abu Dhabi, working—finally—with Brosnan, wrangling camels and his five-year China sojourn that ended at the start of the global pandemic.,The Avenue will release ,The Misfits ,in theaters Friday June 11, and On Demand and Digital Tuesday June 15.,Angela Dawson: Could you discuss assembling this international cast?,Renny Harlin,: The casting started, of course, with Pierce Brosnan. I had previously—a couple of times—tried to make a movie with him. He immediately came to mind when I read the (Robert Henny and Kurt Wimmer) script. Then, when he was onboard, I wanted to build an interesting ensemble around him. I thought Tim Roth would bring some intelligence without being an imposing big guy (as the villain).,For the other roles, I’d been a fan of Jamie Chung whose known for playing strong, female characters. Hermione Corfield I’d seen in a very small role in ,Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and thought she was great. In terms of Mike Angelo—he’s from Thailand and is a huge star both in Thailand and in China (as half of the popular music duo Golf & Mike).,As I had lived in China, I knew him from there. It thought it would be interesting to mix it up and have this truly international cast. I like how it came together. Obviously, you need somebody internationally famous to play the main character in your movie to get it financed, but I also really like using new faces and up-and-comers to build a movie that feels fresh. ,Renny Harlin assembles an international cast, led by Pierce Brosnan, for his high-flying Abu ,... [+], Dhabi-set heist film, 'The Misfits.',Dawson: You have a track record with popular action films including ,Die Hard 2 a,nd ,Cliffhanger,. What’s the secret sauce of making a successful action movie?,Harlin,: That’s a tough question, obviously, but it starts with the characters. You can have all the action in the world, but if you don’t care about the characters, if (the audience) can relate to the characters, then you don’t really have anything else other than spectacle for spectacle’s sake. So, you have to make sure the characters are relatable and that you have a plot that isn’t one that people have seen 1,000 times before and that it’s surprising and the characters are intelligent so that the audience will respect them.,Dawson: You have a sequence in which your protagonists have to cross the desert by camel. So how was it working with these animals? Did you draw some inspiration from David Lean’s ,Lawrence Of Arabia, in filming those sequences?,Harlin,: They are interesting animals and not that easy to deal with as “actors.” And, yes, ,Lawrence Of Arabia, was my inspiration forever, and I did revisit it again to get some inspiration. ,You don’t think of little things like actually shooting people riding camels. I don’t know how they did those scenes 60 years ago where they had to lug in these huge cameras and didn’t have the modern communication devices we have now. That was an insane achievement. Of course, I can tell you that now, having shot in the desert, in the sand, it’s still pretty rough conditions with camels.,Just doing a scene where the actors are sitting on camels and talking, you don’t realize they’re a good 12-15 feet off the ground, so we had to have this vehicle mounted with a crane just to get to their level for the camel camera. That was the first real challenge. Then, just getting them to do what you wanted them to do, it’s a little tricky, and for the actors getting on and off the camels was another challenge. They were riding them for real. It’s dangerous and it’s difficult. Working with horses is challenging enough, but that’s easy compared to working with camels. ,Dawson: There’s a story about how you filmed one scene in Pierce’s hotel room on a day when weather prevented you from shooting outside and you needed a nice hotel room fast. ,Harlin,: It’s true. We quickly needed a location and the only location spectacular enough for the scene was Pierce’s room. That’s kind of unusual that you get to shoot in your star’s room, but Pierce is that kind of guy—very generous and lovely to work with.,Dawson: Your production company, Extraordinary Entertainment, is based in China and you shot three films there in five years. You seem to have been ahead of the curve in terms of Hollywood’s lovefest with China.,Harlin,: I had tried to make a movie twice with Jackie Chan. He sent me the script for ,Skiptrace,, and I thought, “The third time has to be the charm. Let’s do this movie.” So, I went to China without really knowing much about China except what (Westerners) know about it, just the cliché ideas of rice fields and people on bicycles. I started to become educated and began to see how advanced and modern the country is. ,Yes, there is the countryside, where it feels like you’re traveling back 500 years ago and, on the other hand, there are the big cities that are more modern than anything you’ve ever seen. I fell in love with the opposites, the differences of the country. Because my first movie gave me a great take on (the country)—sort of a travelogue of the entire country because we traveled from up north near Mongolia all across the country to Macau, and saw a lot of things in-between. We saw a country with different climates and different kinds of people, different types of architecture and culture—I just fell in love with it. I happened to be the right guy at the right place at the right time. It was just a coincidence. ,Dawson: What stands out as the most memorable part of that experience?,Harlin,: The moviemaking experience was great. The Chinese way of making movies couldn’t be more different from the way they’re made in Hollywood, which is meticulous and very organized in terms of budgets and scheduling. In China, it was surprisingly improvised: you show up and kind of start making stuff up, and it takes however long it takes—whether it’s weeks or months or years and it takes as much money as it needs. I learned a lot from the Chinese crew and I was able to teach them about Hollywood ways. ,The crew liked it because it was organized and the financiers and producers liked it because it was very well-planned and cheaper than what they were used to. So, it was kind of a lovefest, and they asked me to stay. They developed a movie and meanwhile this whole invasion by Hollywood was starting. They were sending over (studio) people for a few days for some Peking duck. I saw how little they knew about China.  You don’t learn how China works by going there for a week. I had now spent more than a year there and I still knew very little but I knew that I knew more than these Hollywood types who had a little bit of what you’d call a superior attitude coming in. They’d say, “This is how it’s done,” but you can’t work like that in China. ,Mutual respect is important and understanding the culture is very important. So, I saw a great opportunity there. They wanted me to work there. I liked working there. I was helping other Hollywood people there and educating the Chinese (film industry) about international filmmaking—both storytelling and the technical side of it. It became clear and made sense, so I stayed for five years. It’s shocking how quickly time flies. I started my own company there and I still have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.,Dawson: Why and when did you leave China?,Harlin,: I left Beijing right before COVID started. I left with one suitcase (expecting to return). Everything else was in my home and offices, and I still haven’t been back. It’s impossible to go back because of the quarantine and regulations right now. To be honest, the political climate hasn’t helped. If you’d asked me a year and a half ago what I see my future being, I would have said, “I’m going to be living in China for the rest of my life making movies there.” But co-productions there became pretty much impossible. I have many Chinese-American co-productions in development but they are right now impossible (to proceed) because of the political situation. And, COVID has had a huge impact on everything, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.,Dawson: What are you doing next?,Harlin,: I don’t know where my current path will take me but I doubt it’s going to be in China. So, I’m making ,The Refuge, (in Bulgaria), which is a horror-thriller. It’s about a young US soldier who is returning to his wife after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Everybody in his family thinks he has PTSD because his whole personality has changed but it turns out it’s not PTSD. He’s actually is possessed by a demon and it has to be exorcised. The movie deals with racial stereotypes and religious stereotypes because the possession is based on beliefs in the Muslim religion. The unexpected hero turns out to be an imam played by Raza Jaffrey (,Homeland,) who has to save this family. The young soldier’s father, played by Jason Flemyng (,Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels,), is a racist who comes to realize that the only man who can save his son is the last person he expected, an American Muslim. The movie, while it is very scary horror film, it deals with some real cultural issues. I’m proud to be shedding light on these issues."
"If You Though The Ever Given Blocking The Suez Canal Was Bad, What’s Coming Could Be Worse","The Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen, China is the primary export terminal from ,... [+], the Pearl River Delta to North America and Europe. - Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images),The container ship ,Ever Given, blockage of the Suez Canal earlier this year attracted global attention to how disruptions to maritime trade routes could impact global supply chains. But recent Covid-19 outbreaks in southern China, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan are threatening to cause more pain as their effects ripple through supply chains over the next few week and months.,A Covid-19 outbreak led to a five-day ,traffic halt, for inbound container deliveries to the Yantian International Container Terminal in Shenzhen at the end of May. Yantian is the largest container terminal in the Pearl River delta, and one of the largest in the world. It has natural deep-water berths that can handle the largest container ships like the ,Ever Given, ,which almost certainly has called there numerous times. It is the dominant port in South China for exports destined for North America and Europe. When we visited there in January 2020, we were told that the terminal handled 20,000 trucks a day, dropping export containers destined for loading on ships or picking up imports or empties. The Port is operated by Hutchison Ports of Hong Kong.,The outbreak led to a shutdown of the west side of the terminal, though it continued to operate at around 30% of its overall capacity. Last year they told me that their worst truck backup stretched 20 kilometers. Recent reports of extensive traffic backups suggest that this time it might have been even worse. At times as many as 40 container ships were ,waiting, for a berth, which reminds us of the back-ups this year on inbound ships at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Yantian started up a new e-commerce export consolidation center last fall. They are a critical link in more supply chains than most people realize.,The Shekou Port is located on the western side of Shenzhen, China,There are several ,other ports, in the area, notably Hong Kong, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Shekou and Dachan Bay in western Shenzhen. But rerouting trucks and congestion at those ports make it hard to replace the lost capacity from Yantian. Many of the container lines even skipped port calls at Yantian to try to keep their ships running at some semblance of a schedule, but the overall lost capacity exceeded the losses from the closure of the Suez Canal for six days, capacity that is impossible to replace. Because of normal ship transit times, the ripple effects won’t be felt on the West Coast of the U.S. for two or three weeks, and perhaps a month in Northern Europe. But it’s coming.,Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia have shuttered factory production during lockdowns. A ,surge in cases in Malaysia, with a case rate per million people more than double that of India triggered a two week lockdown. This has slowed production at many factories, forcing them to operate at reduced capacity. Outbreaks at ,factories in northern Vietnam, and a soaring case rate there suggest more troubles lie ahead. Bac Giang, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh provinces have a large number of foreign invested industrial parks, and some chip and semiconductor production have had to close temporarily as a preventative measure. With the situation coming under control, they have started to partially reopen with enhanced safety measures.,In Taiwan, a country that handled the pandemic exceptionally well, a Covid-19 ,outbreak, at King Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) is a big problem for the semiconductor supply chain. KYEC is the world’s largest chip testing service provider, and it had to shut down all operations over the past weekend. The Taiwan government ordered it to stop foreign migrant workers, who made up 30% of the labor force, from working. KYEC is a little know company outside of the semiconductor industry, but they provide a service known as wafer probing. After a semiconductor wafer is processed by a foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) or United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), the wafers have to be tested to identify all the good chips and any that are defective. The good chips are then selected, sliced from the wafer, and put in packages. Sometimes foundries do the wafer probing, but sometimes they outsource testing because specialists like KYEC are very flexible and can handle certain types and batches of chips more easily. I wrote a case on KYEC’s competitor ,Ardentec, a number of years ago, and I was amazed at the level of granularity on display in the complex value chain of making a semiconductor chip.,All this news tells us that the world’s supply chain woes are not over, and more broadly, that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. Until all the world is vaccinated and gets the contagion under control, we can expect continued disruption and surprises. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to feel the effects."
"3 In 10 Republicans Believe Wacky Conspiracy Theory Trump Will Be ‘Reinstated’ As President This Year, Poll Shows","While most Americans dismiss the possibility, a significant chunk of Republicans believe the conspiracy theory buoyed by some of Donald Trump’s allies (and, reportedly, believed by the former president himself) that he’ll be back in the White House by the end of the year, a poll published Wednesday suggests. ,Former U.S. President Donald Trump leaves Trump Tower in Manhattan on May 18, 2021 in New York City. ,... [+], ,The ,Politico,/Morning Consult ,survey, of 1,990 registered voters found respondents were broadly dismissive of the notion Trump could be “reinstated” as president. ,A decisive majority (72%) across the political spectrum deemed it “not very likely” or “not likely at all” Trump will have his old job by the end of the year. ,However, self-identified Republicans were less quick to dismiss the conspiracy theory. ,While 61% of GOP respondents labeled Trump’s return unlikely, some 29% said they believe he will be made president again. ,This compares to 84% of the Democrats surveyed who said Trump won’t be reinstated and 13% who said he will be. ,All in all, 19% of the people surveyed for the poll said it was either “somewhat likely” or “very likely” Trump will be reinstated as president this year. ,The conspiracy theory Trump will be reinstated as president, which has become popular among ,QAnon believers,, stems from the false claims still being pushed by some Republicans that the 2020 election was rigged. Trump has ,reportedly, become fixated with the ongoing GOP-commissioned election audit in Arizona and is pushing for similar ballot reviews across the country, telling allies (though daughter-in-law Lara Trump has since ,denied, this) the success of the recounts could result in his return to the White House this year. Of course, election officials across the country have maintained that last year’s presidential election was one of the safest in history and have denied the possibility it was marred by widespread fraud. ,As ,Forbes, has previously ,reported,, some of Trump’s more outlandish supporters and allies have advocated for antidemocratic maneuvers to seize control of the White House. Trump’s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn ,called, for a Myanmar-style military coup at a QAnon conference late last month (he has since walked back the comments). ,“Lara Trump Dismisses Reports Trump Believes He Will Be Reinstated In August” ,(Forbes) ,“Maggie Haberman: Trump Telling People He Expects To Be ‘Reinstated’ As President By August”, (Forbes) ,“Trump Says GOP Will Retake Congress, White House ‘Sooner Than You Think’ In Fundraising Video”, (Forbes)"
Taylor Swift Beats Her Own Record For The Largest Sales Week Of 2021 With An Old Release,"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Taylor Swift attends the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los ,... [+], Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording Academy ),Taylor Swift rules over the Billboard 200 albums chart in America this week, but not with a just-released effort. In fact, she doesn’t even control the tally with her most recent full-length, but rather a slightly older collection. As if being able to surge back to the summit of the most competitive ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. wasn’t impressive enough, she’s topped her own best showing this year to score the largest sales frame of 2021...and it’s with a title that has already moved hundreds of thousands of units.,This frame, Swift dominates the Billboard 200 with ,Evermore,, one of her nine No. 1s on the chart, as the project returns to the summit for a fourth nonconsecutive turn in charge. The project, which arrived with no warning in December 2020 and which served as a follow-up to her first surprise album ,Folklore,, bounds 73 spaces thanks to clever marketing and the release of the project on vinyl.,Evermore, moved 202,000 equivalent units in the past tracking frame, with ,192,000, of those being actual purchases, spread out across multiple formats. That first number isn’t the largest equivalent sum of the year, but ,Evermore, now claims the biggest actual sales figure of 2021, stealing that record from another Swift release.,Before this week, the most impressive sales sum accrued by any album so far this year was 179,000 copies, which Swift managed with her latest album ,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),. That project, a re-recorded take on her sophomore set ,Fearless,, opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 back in April with a hefty purchase total, as Swift can sell albums like few in the business. ,Evermore, made history this frame as it didn’t just top the previous record for the most vinyl albums sold in one week, it ,completely decimated the previous best showing,. The singer-songwriter’s second proper alternative release sold 102,000 copies on wax, which topples the prior record of just 40,000 copies in a seven-day period. That honor was held by Jack White’s ,Lazaretto, for a number of years. Swift’s second surprise album also sold very well on CD and on digital platforms, with plastic discs selling 69,000 copies. Fans rushed to get discounted “digitally signed” copies on the star’s website, and she was able to sell 21,000 online-only editions of the set."
"If Congress Passes A Federal NIL Law, Here Are 5 Things The Law Should Say","WASHINGTON - JUNE 5: The U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images),The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is holding a hearing at 10 A.M. this morning to discuss the topic of college athlete name, image and likeness rights. While the hearing is receiving a lot of media attention, the timing is a tad bit awkward, as after years of ignoring the collective minimization of college athletes’ economic rights, Congress has only now taken notice — right as both the Supreme Court and numerous individual states seem poised on their own to address the NCAA’s economic restraints on college athletes.,If Congress ultimately uses today’s hearing as an opportunity to discuss potential name, image and likeness law, there is undoubtedly going to be a lot of disagreement on what the federal law should say, especially with many disparate bills already percolating. However, if Congress is even at all interested in equity for college athletes, here are five basics items that belong in even the most innocuous of federal bills. These items make a wonderful starting point for today’s conversation:,1. Any federal NIL bill should acknowledge that college athletes are human beings that deserve the same economic freedom from monopsony restraints under U.S. laws — including federal antitrust law — as any other members of society.,2. Any federal NIL bill should recognize that the collective curtailing of free market opportunities to license one’s name, image and likeness harms the economic rights of college athletes, who are individuals that are already historically disadvantaged within our society either as ethnic minorities, female athletes (many being gymnasts), or individuals from lower socio-economic communities.,3. As such, any federal NIL bill ,while recognizing the rights of ,individual ,colleges when negotiating with athletes, should explicitly declare that any agreement among a collection of eight or more colleges to curtail the right to license one’s name, image and likeness must be treated as a ,per se, violation of antitrust law. Any bill should also shift the economic burdens of any successful antitrust challenge of concerted NIL restraints from the prospective athlete plaintiff to the defendant colleges and allow for an easy to obtain temporary restraining order against the collective activity — thus substantially reducing the time and cost for athletes needing to challenge such behavior. ,4. Any federal NIL bill also should recognize that individual states are free to provide broader legal protections to college athletes than the federal bill and grant their athletes explicit NIL rights should they choose. Thus, the federal bill should create a baseline floor for athlete protections, but it cannot, and should not, trump the rights of certain states to grant the athletes greater protection.,5. Finally, any federal NIL bill should clearly explain that no group of eight or more colleges may take steps to ban any other member college from athletic competition simply based on complying with their home state’s law. This should place and end to past threats by NCAA leadership to ban California member colleges if they complied with the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is one of the newest NCAA threats of violating antitrust law. And, it should end the days of the NCAA, as a monopolist college sports trade association, attempting to proclaim itself as being above state law.,These proposals are simple, reasonable and effective. They seek to preserve economic free markets. And they leave most of the rulemaking to individual state governments. It is a bit different from what many individuals in Congress are discussing. But perhaps, the recognition of state rights and free economic markets is all that is needed to push the conversation ahead on this most important, and needlessly controversial, topic.,____________,Marc Edelman (,Marc@MarcEdelman.com,) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of ,Edelman Law,.

Wade,, the landmark Supreme Court decision on abortion being a constitutional right: 58% of Americans are against overturning the decision, while just 32% are for it. ,Since 1989—when Gallup began asking the question—Americans’ support for keeping ,Roe v. Wade ,in place has fluctuated between 52% and 66%.  ,The poll comes weeks after the Supreme Court ,announced, it will hear a case involving Mississippi’s ban on abortions that take place after 15 weeks. Anti-abortion activists are hopeful the case will result in the new conservative bloc of the court, 6-3, striking down the standards laid out in ,Roe v. Wade,. The case, ,Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization,, deals specifically with the issue of whether “all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.”,In response to the Supreme Court case, congressional Democrats this week ,reintroduced, a bill that would safeguard abortion rights under federal law. ,Congressional Democrats Reintroduce Bill To Protect Abortion Access Amid Supreme Court Threat, (Forbes),Supreme Court To Consider Mississippi’s Abortion Ban In Move That Could Challenge Roe V.

 ,, a Canadian oil and gas pipeline company, has been operating its ,Line 5 pipeline ,in defiance of an order from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down Line 5’s operations effective May 12, 2021. The pipeline, which runs 1,083 kilometers from northern Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, was built in 1953 and carries approximately 500,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas liquids from western Canadian refineries.,Governor Whitmer claims that the pipeline, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac, is a “ticking time bomb” posing a grave threat to Michigan’s environment and economy. She asserts that its continued use violates a 1953 easement agreement between Canada and the State of Michigan. ,Whitmer’s predecessor as Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder, reached an agreement with Canada in 2018 for building a tunnel within the bedrock of the Straits and then installing a new section of the pipeline inside that tunnel. Governor Whitmer, who came into office in 2019, could not reach agreement with Enbridge on timelines for that work to proceed. Now she demands that Enbridge cease using the pipeline altogether.,Should Line 5 cease operations, even temporarily, the effects on both American and Canadian aviation specifically would be enormous. In turn, the secondary socio-economic impacts for both countries would be significant, but potentially devastating for Canada. Its aviation industry has arguably suffered much more than in the United States from the long siege of the COVID pandemic.,Toronto’s Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada’s largest airport serving Canada’s biggest, wealthiest, and arguably most important city, receives 100% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Potentially initially, but possibly also for some considerable period of time, it might have to cease operating entirely – or at least substantially curtain them - if Line 5 were to suddenly close. ,Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport ,obtains ,50% of its jet fuel from Line 5. Detroit’s economy, already on a long downward trend over many decades, would struggle to fully recover. Line 5 also feeds into Enbridge’s Line 9, which provides feedstock to refineries in Quebec. Those refineries, in turn, produce jet fuel for airports in Montreal and Quebec City, who also might see their services curtailed. While perhaps not suffering impacts as harsh as in Toronto and Detroit, the impacts of a Line 5 shut down on aviation in those cities would still be significant for their regions, and for Canada as a whole.,Predictably, the actions by Governor Whitmer have provoked outrage in Canada, including within the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that controls the Canadian Parliament. Ironically, the party stands on a platform of staunch liberalism when it comes to matters of the environment generally. Yet on May 12, 2021, the Trudeau led government took the highly unusual step of intervening in a United States court proceeding in the Western District of Michigan by filing a legal brief in which it asserted that the ,shutdown ,is unlawful and constitutes a threat to Canada’s energy and environmental security.  ,Shutting down Line 5 is “non-negotiable,” according to Canadian National Resources Minister Seamus O’Reagan, who worked with Canadian Provincial Ministers on the American legal filing. Among other points opposing Governor Whitmer’s action, that filing expressly invoked the 1977 Transit Pipeline Treaty between the two countries that prevents either side from interfering with energy transshipments through the other’s territory. That 1977 Treaty was ratified by, among others, then Senator Joseph Biden.  ,Canada’s legal brief was direct: “The United States undertook a solemn and reciprocal commitment to Canada…not to interfere with the operations of international hydrocarbon transit pipelines. That obligation, with ,legally binding, effect under international law, expressly applies to any measures instituted by a ‘public authority in the territory of either party’ — including the State of Michigan and this court…”  ,The disruption would not be limited to the large hub airports and also to aviation. According to the ,Detroit Free Press,, “Detroit and Ohio refineries served by Line 5 send about 23,000 barrels of jet fuel daily to Ontario by rail, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration — some of which could arguably get diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport if a Line 5 shutdown creates the jet fuel pinch some expect.” Still, that would not be nearly enough to cover the combined needs of Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports in Michigan.  ,Canada’s aviation issues would be even more pronounced. While Montreal’s Pierre Trudeau International Airport and Quebec City’s Jean Lesage International Airport may have potential ,alternative sources, for jet fuel, Toronto likely does not.  ,It is estimated that to ,make up for the loss of the pipeline,, Ontario would need to add a massive 2,000 trucks or 500 rail cars going one-way ,each day,. The bulk of those would not be used for jet fuel. Putting aside the potential secondary impacts of having that many vehicles transporting highly flammable fuel over long distances on a daily basis, including but certainly not limited to the excess greenhouse emissions, without that fuel at its largest hub, Canadian aviation, already battered by the coronavirus and lacking the federal assistance provided In the United States, would suffer yet another massive hit.,The Line 5 situation is another case of externalities not contemplated by policy makers as they make their decisions. This is not just the law of unintended consequences. It is the inability to truly think through the results of any governmental action.,It is doubtful that Governor Whitmer thought much about aviation when she ordered Line 5 closed. However, should any of the above described impacts occur, she will have to deal with those issues, as well as any other consequences. ,Were this not a different country being affected, one wonders what the FAA and United States airlines would say if they were to wake up and suddenly find out that half of the jet fuel to one of the country’s most important airports is suddenly gone. At the very least, they now must plan for these scenarios as the pipeline wars continue unabated."
